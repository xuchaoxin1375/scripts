SK0000002-UK,Celestron StarSense Explorer - LT80AZ,"<p><strong>Celestron has reinvented the manual telescope with the StarSense Explorer - the first telescope that uses your smartphone to analyze the night sky and calculate its position in real time. The StarSense Explorer is ideal for beginners thanks to its user-friendly interface and detailed tutorials. It's like having your own personal guide to the night sky.</strong></p>
<p><em>Dock, launch, explore:</em><br>Leave complicated star charts, imprecise planetarium programs, and computerized mounts behind. With the StarSense Explorer, finding objects has never been easier, faster, and more accurate. Within minutes of setting up the telescope, you can begin moving confidently in the sky.</p>
<p>Simply place your phone in the unique StarSense Dock and launch the StarSense Explorer app. After aiming your phone at the telescope's optics (which can be done in two minutes), the StarSense Explorer generates a list of currently visible celestial objects. Make your selection, and arrows appear on the screen to help you move the telescope. When the object is visible in the eyepiece, the crosshairs turn green.</p>
<p><em>Smartphone compatibility:</em><br>StarSense Explorer works with most current smartphones, including iPhone 6 and newer and most devices running Android 7.1.2 or higher manufactured since 2016. For a full compatibility list, click here .</p>
<p><em>Patent pending StarSense Sky technology:</em><br>StarSense Explorer uses patent-pending technology and your smartphone to determine exactly where the telescope is pointed in the night sky. A Lost-in-Space Algorithm (LISA), the same algorithm used by orbiting satellites to correctly reorient themselves, helps the app match the star patterns it detects with its internal database.</p>
<p>While other astronomy apps claim to help you find objects, they rely solely on the phone's compass, gyroscopes, and accelerometers, which are not as accurate as LISA's technology. No other app can tell you exactly when your target will be visible in the eyepiece.</p>
<p><em>Robust azimuthal mount:</em><br>The StarSense Explorer LT's intuitive alt-azimuth mount makes it easy to point the telescope at the target. A fine adjustment knob for the altitude axis helps you fine-tune the telescope to the object and track targets as the Earth rotates beneath the night sky. Everything is mounted on a large, height-adjustable tripod.<br></p>
<p>Perfect views with high-quality optics:<br>You can expect sharp, bright images through this 80mm refractor. The fully coated glass optics provide increased light transmission, making details in celestial objects more clearly visible. The telescope also features a 90-degree prism for an erect image, allowing you to observe nature during the day including birds, wildlife, scenery and more.</p>
<p>Perfect for the city as well as dark locations:<br>Even if you live in a place with slightly bright skies and moderate light pollution, the StarSense Explorer is powerful enough to locate Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, the Orion Nebula, binary stars, and some of the most famous celestial objects.</p>
<p>However, if you can move the telescope to a slightly darker location, even more objects will become visible. The entire telescope weighs just 4.17kg, making it perfectly portable and easy to take with you on your next camping trip or to a remote observing site.</p>

SK0000004-UK,Bresser Messier AR-90S/500 EXOS 2,"<p><b>The Bresser Messier AR-90S Refractor telescope is designed for both ambitious beginners and advanced observers alike. This small refractor offers some great views of both the larger Solar System objects as well as a whole range of deep sky targets such as star clusters and brighter galaxies and nebula.</b></p>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div>Although better suited for large deep sky objects like galaxies, nebula and star clusters, when using a stronger eyepiece / Barlow (sold seperately) this 90mm refractor telescope can still also provide some really sharp views of the moons surface along with some details on the larger planets such as Jupiters cloud bands as well as Saturns rings (1.5 billion km away). If you venture to darker skies away from the city lights then its also possible to make some nice observations of the brighter galaxies such as Bodes Galaxy or Andromeda Galaxy as well as a whole range of star clusters and brighter nebula such as the Orion Nebula.<br><br>
</div>
<div>With an Aperture of 90mm @ f/5.5, this refractor offers some good light gathering characteristics which is especially useful if you would like to try your hand at some Astrophotography. The sharp and sturdy 'Hexafoc' focuser enables precise focusing and there is also a 1/4"" mounting bolt on the handle of the telescope to separately mount a DSLR camera if required. </div>

SK0000005-UK,Bresser Messier AR-80/640 Nano AZ Telescope,"<p><strong>The Bresser Messier AR-80/640 Nano is a great starter telescope for both adults and young children looking for a first telescope to view some of the larger objects in the solar system such as the Moon and the larger planets.</strong></p>
<p>Solar System objects like the Moon will appear nice and sharp, especially the larger craters and surface features such as the 'Montes Apenninus' mountain range. Under steady sky conditions, using a stronger eyepiece eg. a 15mm eyepiece and x2 Barlow (sold seperately) it will also possible to make out Saturns rings or the two main cloud belts on Jupiter as well as Jupiters 3 larger moons.</p>
<p>You can even share your fantastic views of space with your friends and family, as this telescope also includes a small smartphone holder so you can use your smartphone to capture some nice photos through the eyepiece.<br><br><em>The Mount:</em><br>An essential part of any beginner telescope is the mounts simplicity, and the Nano ALT-AZ mount is exactly that. Having a telescope that is quick and easy to setup and use means you will most likely use it a lot more often - an important consideration when choosing a telescope. This is why Alt-AZ mounts are so popular with both beginners and experienced amateurs as a convenient grab and go telescope. The Nano Alt-AZ mount offers a sturdy platform with smooth controls to allow you to effortlessly scan the night sky.<br><br>The mount is as easy to use as a photo tripod, it is just more stable and easily carries telescopes weighing up to 4kg and with a weight of only 3.4kg, its also very easy to store and transport. The telescope is securely held by a clamp for 44mm prism rails, (the so-called GP Level) which is an international standard and all telescopes with a GP prism rail can also be used on this mount.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br></p>

Now the second generation of this telescope, the Bresser NT-150/750 comes with an improved Hexafoc focusser and fast parabolic main mirror. </strong></p>
<p>The Bresser Messier NT-150 telescope excels with high rigidity and tack-sharp parabolic optics. The 150mm (6"") aperture enables you to observe some bright nebulas in the depth of space or find the remnants of gigantic stellar explosions from the year 1054 in the Taurean constellation, or scan the glowing bands of the great Orion Nebula. Detect the famous Whirlpool Galaxy in the Big Dipper or find the Dumpbell-Nebula in the constellation Vulpecula (little fox). The high rigidity of the EXOS-2 mount allows for a very relaxed observation experience and is also helpful for those making their first attempts at astrophotography.</p>
<p>We recommend a Telescope such as this for those looking to engage into a more advanced level of Astronomy with the option of progressing further into Astrophotography, as the 6"" aperture of the Telescope and the sturdy Equatorial Mount (with the option to upgrade to a tracked version) means that this package offers a great range of targets to see both visually and through a camera.  <br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>BRESSER EXOS-2 Equatorial Mount:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Bresser EXOS-2 is a rugged German Equatorial Mount offering high rigidity and precision tracking for visual observation as well as astrophotography.

Make your selection, and arrows appear on the screen to help you move the telescope. When the object is visible in the eyepiece, the crosshairs turn green.</p>
<p>Smartphone compatibility:<br>StarSense Explorer works with most current smartphones, including iPhone 6 and newer and most devices running Android 7.1.2 or higher manufactured since 2016. For a full compatibility list, click here .</p>
<p>Patent pending StarSense Sky technology:<br>StarSense Explorer uses patent-pending technology and your smartphone to determine exactly where the telescope is pointed in the night sky. A Lost-in-Space Algorithm (LISA), the same algorithm used by orbiting satellites to correctly reorient themselves, helps the app match the star patterns it detects with its internal database.</p>
<p>While other astronomy apps claim to help you find objects, they rely solely on the phone's compass, gyroscopes, and accelerometers, which are not as accurate as LISA's technology. No other app can tell you exactly when your target will be visible in the eyepiece.</p>
<p><em>Robust azimuthal mount:</em><br>The StarSense Explorer LT's intuitive alt-azimuth mount makes it easy to point the telescope at the target. A fine adjustment knob for the altitude axis helps you fine-tune the telescope to the object and track targets as the Earth rotates beneath the night sky. Everything is mounted on a large, height-adjustable tripod.</p>
<p><em>Perfect views with high-quality optics:</em><br>With its large 102mm (4"") objective lens, this telescope has enough light gathering power to see impressive details in celestial objects. You can expect sharp, bright views of Jupiter's four Galilean moons, its cloud bands, and its Great Red Spot, as well as the rings of Saturn and the Trapezium stars in the Orion Nebula. Don't miss the beautiful Pleiades open star cluster! Celestron's XLT coating improves light transmission, making details in celestial objects more clearly visible.</p>
<p><em>Perfect for the city as well as dark locations:</em><br>Even if you live in a place with slightly bright skies and moderate light pollution, the StarSense Explorer is powerful enough to locate Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, the Orion Nebula, binary stars, and some of the most famous celestial objects.</p>
<p>However, if you can move the telescope to a slightly darker location, even more objects will become visible. With this 4-inch refractor and relatively dark skies, the Andromeda Galaxy, the globular cluster M13 in Hercules, and many others are easily visible.</p>
<p>The entire telescope weighs only 6.4kg, making it perfectly portable and easy to take with you on your next camping trip or to a remote observing site.</p>

SK0000022-UK,"Celestron NexStar Evolution - 9.25"" EdgeHD (With StarSense)","<p><strong>The innovative NexStar Evolution is a compact, portable and mechanically solid telescope. This set adds the StarSense AutoAlign module to the Evo mount, taking the alignment process off your hands: the built-in camera orients itself to the sky and initiates the telescope for computer control and automatic tracking. The 9.25"" EdgeHD tube delivers a flat, bright image of the sky.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to do anything during setup, the telescope automatically orients itself with the sky within a few minutes! With the additional options, the NexStar Evolution 9.25"" HD set is an extremely powerful, user-friendly and quick-to-use combination.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Differences between the EdgeHD tube instead of the standard Schmidt-Cassegrain : </em><br>The EdgeHD telescopes not only offer photographers the advantage of a flattened field of view, but also have an improved focusing mechanism, ventilation openings with fine dust sieves for faster temperature equalization and, above all, the Schmidt plate is prepared for Hyperstar - so you can transform the optics into an ultra-fast astrograph with 400mm/f2.<br>
</li>
<li>A 2x Barlow lens, doubles the focal length for visual observations or planetary photography.<br>
</li>
<li>1.25"" moon filter.<br>
</li>
<li>StarSense module – The telescope automatically orients itself to the starry sky, all you have to do is set it up and switch it on.<br>
</li>
<li>StarPointer Pro instead of StarPointer – With aiming circles and brighter, dimmable LED is also suitable for daytime observations.<br>
</li>
<li>Perfect WiFi control via tablet or smartphone.<br>
</li>
<li>The planetarium program on your smartphone shows you the current sky view or a list of observation targets for your location. The SkyPortal app for iOS and Android also supports automatic initialization of the computer control (""alignment"") via the StarSense module.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Simple and convenient operation:</em><br>The NexStar Evolution telescopes have been developed based on customer feedback from the past few years. They offer many well thought-out details so that you can enjoy the most beautiful night possible under the starry sky. </p>
<p>No more worrying about batteries or an external power supply. The NexStar Evolution is the first amateur telescope to have a built-in lithium iron phosphate battery. One charge lasts up to ten hours. You can even use the Evolution's USB port to power other devices you want to use at night.</p>
<p>The NexStar Evolution is easy to set up thanks to the large, ergonomic handles. The steel tripod has markings so you can easily extend all legs to the same length. The azimuth and elevation clamps allow you to point the telescope at a target even without power. Up to seven eyepieces can be stored in two storage compartments - one even has a dimmable red LED light.</p>
<p>More power and safety thanks to lithium iron phosphate battery:<br>Instead of a typical lithium polymer battery, a lithium iron phosphate battery is used in the Evolution telescopes. These LiFePO 4 batteries have several advantages over simple LiPo batteries:</p>
<p><strong>High safety &amp; Reliability:</strong><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike LiPo batteries, LiFePO 4 batteries cannot explode or ignite, but are considered intrinsically safe. The improved power density ensures a high load capacity even with continuous current consumption.<br>
</li>
<li>Long service life and cycle stability.<br>
</li>
<li>Wide temperature range for storage and operation<br>
</li>
<li>Low self-discharge<br>
</li>
<li>Excellent tracking accuracy, suitable for astrophotography</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in astrophotography, a NexStar Evolution is an excellent and affordable way to get started. It's the only fork-mounted telescope series in this price range with worm gears, along with improved motors. Planetary photography with a DSLR or a planetary camera is also no problem at all, and with a polar wedge you can also set it up equatorially to take long exposure deep sky images, be it with a DSLR or an Astro Camera.</p>
<p>The Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes with the StarBright XLT coating deliver bright, sharp images and are just as interesting for visual observers as they are for astrophotographers.</p>

SK0000023-UK,"Explore Scientific 254 Dobsonian Telescope - 10""","<p><strong>Explore Scientific Ultra Light Dobson 254mm Telescope - GENERATION II</strong><br><br>No type of telescope has changed amateur astronomy as much as the Dobsonian design telescopes. Before John Dobson introduced the Dobson telescope, the vast majority of amateur telescopes consisted of small lens telescopes with primitive mechanics - just enough to barely make out the polar caps of Mars or the rings of Saturn. Larger telescopes, such as Schmidt-Cassegrains, were reserved for a much more expensive and specialised market, however this all changed with the introduction of the Dobsonian Telescope. The Dobsonian design combines simple but effective mechanics with the largest possible aperture, which has given the Dobsonian telescope a unique triumph worldwide. Nowhere else do you get so much light gathering ability for your money as with a good Dobsonian Telescope.<br><br>At 254mm (10"") Aperture things start to get very serious in terms of what you can see through the eyepiece. The Moon and Planets are simply awe inspiring and even fainter objects like Galaxies and nebula start to show lots of real detail - Particularly if you are viewing from a dark sky location. A telescope with a mirror diameter of 254mm collects more than 1300 times as much light than the naked eye.<br><br>The easy disassembly of this telescope allows for problem-free transport, even in relatively small cars - the assembly then is quick and easy without the need for tools. The entire construction has been optimized for maximum stiffness without neglecting weight. The combination of large height wheels with an optimized aluminum sandwich construction enables the finest correction movements at the highest magnifications. The focus position has already been prepared for the use of a coma corrector. A device with a mirror diameter of 254mm collects more than 1300 times as much light as the naked eye. Details on the planets become visible even to inexperienced observers, and countless deep-sky objects show structures. Bright star clusters are dissolved down to the core, and the sight of the Terminator on the moon becomes an unforgettable experience.<br><br><strong>Transport dimensions for mobile use:</strong><br></p>

SK0000024-UK,Bresser Messier AR-152L/760 EXOS-2 PMC 8,"<p><strong>This is the perfect Telescope for Astronomers looking for a very capable planetary Telescope as well as a Telescope capable of deep space Astrophotography. This complete set consists of the Bresser Messier AR-152L/760 Refractor Telescope and the modern EXOS-2 PMC-Eight GoTo Mount. With the large aperture and focal length of 760mm, the high-quality optics deliver razor-sharp, high-contrast images that will impress even the most experienced Astronomer. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Telescope:</strong></p>
<p>The Bresser Messier AR-152L is a very capable for detailed Planetary observations using an optional Barlow or Focal extender, however the relatively fast f/5 focal ratio means that this Telescope is also perfectly capable for deep space astrophotography too. The combination of large aperture and long focal length enables sharp, high-contrast images that will impress you every time. And with the high-quality objective solar filter, you can also safely observe our own star. (Caution: Never point the telescope at the sun without a solar filter!)</p>
<p><strong>The EXOS-2 PMC-Eight Mount:</strong></p>
<p>The Explore Scientific EXOS-2 PMC-Eight GoTo Mount is equipped with a modern and very precise GoTo control system. It consists of a robust Wi-Fi controller unit that provides all the necessary interfaces. The NEMA-11 stepper motors are directly connected to this unit via cable, and an ST-4 compatible autoguider interface is also available. In addition, the control system supports micro-stepping to ensure precise tracking.</p>
<p><em>Intuitive operation via app and graphical star chart:</em><br>The ExploreStars App, developed specifically for the PMC-Eight system, impresses with a very well-designed, intuitive user interface. The featured 'alignment stars' for initializing the control system, as well as all celestial objects in the database, are displayed as a star chart with additional text information. All these objects can be easily viewed and selected.</p>
<p><em>Powerful controller unit with Open GoTo for customization:</em><br>The heart of the controller unit consists of a completely autonomous 2-channel multi-processor with 8 CPUs and a Wi-Fi Ethernet 10/100 adapter with IP function. This allows remote operation via browser, ASCOM, app, or serial connection. The Open GoTo also allows you to write your own firmware and upload it to the controller unit. This enables custom adjustments to the device’s functions as well as the creation of custom object lists, etc.</p>
<p><em>Polar finder included:</em><br>The included and pre-installed polar finder scope allows for quick and precise polar alignment for longer exposure times without star trails. The integrated LED lighting unit further enhances the comfort of using the polar finder.</p>

SK0000025-UK,"Bresser Messier 254 Dobsonian Telescope - 10""","<p><strong>The Bresser Messier 10"" Dobsonian is an extremely large Reflector telescope which offers amateur Astronomers of all levels some of the most spectacular views and experiences of our Solar Systems and other deep space objects. Although they are quite big, Dobsonian designs like this are extremely easy and intuitive to use.</strong></p>
<p>The optical diameter of 254mm (10"") does not limit your observations to solar system objects such as the moon or the planets - At this size of telescope you will reach much further into deep space and explore globular / open star clusters, nebulae and galaxies, all in much more detail than smaller telescopes.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">With a Telescope of this aperture objects are beginning to show some structure: globular clusters are no longer only fuzzy circles, but are resolved into masses of individual stars. Nebulae, that can only be barely detected in smaller scopes, start to reveal structures within. The excellent Hexafoc focuser boosts a large 2.5"" diameter so that you don't have vignetting in big widefield eyepieces that can occur in smaller focuser barrels.</p>
<p>The big altitude wheels handle the large heavy optics without issue - and if you decide to use even larger accessories (like a bino-viewer with two eyepieces) then you can move the tube in its tube rings and achieve balance within seconds. If you need to transport or store the telescope, the rocker box disassembles (and re-assembles) very easily.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>Telescope Specs:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""></p>

SK0000026-UK,Celestron NexStar - 6SE,"<p><strong>Each Celestron Nexstar SE telescope is exceptionally easy to use and offers all the conveniences of a modern, computerized telescope that can automatically locate over 38,000 objects and even suggests which celestial objects are best observed from your location at the moment. They are also suitable for even getting started in astrophotography.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the powerful SkyAlign technology, setting up the telescope correctly to find even the most difficult galaxies is no longer a problem. Simply point the telescope at three stars and it will be ready for use in no time. This gives you an exceptionally affordable telescope with a range of features that previous generations of amateur astronomers could only have dreamed of (Note: you only need to see the three ""guide stars"", you don't need to know them).</p>
<p>You can even remotely control this telescope with your iPhone, iPad or Windows PC via WiFi using the optional SkyQ-Link WiFi adapter and the SkyQ app, which is available separately from the Apple AppStore - simply use the star map on the screen. So if you are looking for a telescope with the most modern control electronics, then choose the Celestron NexStar SE. With the optional StarSense module, the telescope even takes over the initialization in the starry sky itself - all you have to do is set up the telescope, switch it on and wait three minutes.</p>
<p><em>The NexStar 6SE - the lightweight all-rounder for deep sky and planets:</em><br>The NexStar 6SE is the middle of the range Schmidt-Cassegrain in the NexStar SE series with a 6"" aperture. It is the ideal compromise between portability and performance - with this aperture, globular clusters are partially resolved, for example, and galaxies and nebulae are easy to see under dark skies. Near cities, nebula filters help to block out the scattered light from cities.</p>
<p>The telescope has the 1.25"" focuser connection that is common in astronomy. This means that all common astronomical 1.25"" eyepieces (plug size: 31.7mm) can be used which covers all useful magnifications and enables quick switching between different magnifications. Adapters are also available to use 2"" eyepieces and accessories.</p>
<p>SLR cameras and numerous other accessories can also be connected using a separately available T-adapter. The T-thread is a standard item that can be used to connect almost any accessory - from SLR cameras to binocular attachments.</p>
<p><em>The NexStar 6/8SE mount:</em><br>The mount of the 6SE and 8SE telescopes are larger and more stable than the mount of the smaller models. This azimuthal single-arm mount is optimized to be ready for use quickly and easy to transport. Unlike the classic parallactic mount, you do not have to spend time aligning the telescope to the north, setting the polar height or taking counterweights with you. The mount is simply set up horizontally and after alignment (in which you simply set any three bright stars), the computer automatically ensures that the telescope moves to the desired objects and keeps them in the eyepiece: the automatic tracking automatically compensates for the rotation of the earth.</p>
<p>This makes the SE telescopes ideal for anyone who wants to observe the starry sky themselves: very portable, quickly ready for use and with all the necessary comfort.</p>
<p>The telescope is attached to the mount with a standard prism rail with quick coupling, so it can be easily removed. The mount can also provide stable support for other telescopes up to approx. 5.5kg. However, this is not necessary for transport: the complete mount including telescope is very handy and fits, for example, in the separately available, padded transport case. It is simply attached to the stable steel tripod with three easy-to-grip screws; a centering pin helps when placing it on the tripod.</p>
<p>The NexStar 6/8SE mount also offers everything you need for photography: lunar photography with an SLR camera or planetary photography with a video camera are also possible without any problems in azimuthal operation with the correct camera adapter. Long exposures are also possible using the optional Heavy Duty Deluxe polar wedge: The mount is aligned parallel to the earth's axis, like a classic parallactic (""astronomical"") mount. </p>
<p>A software installed in the hand controller helps you to easily align the mount with high precision even without a polar finder. This not only prevents the image field from rotating when you photograph for example a lunar eclipse over a long period of time but also allows deep sky imaging. An AUX connection enables the connection of additional accessories - from GPS receivers to StarSense modules.</p>
<p><em>Comprehensive star catalogs and TOUR function for an overview:</em><br>The hand controller contains a database with over 38,000 objects. These include, of course, the planets of the solar system as well as countless galaxies, gas nebulae, star clusters and interesting stars. Are you having trouble choosing? Then use the TOUR mode, which shows you a selection of the most beautiful objects every evening and explains them on the display.</p>
<p><em>SkyAlign - Setup without knowledge of the sky:</em><br>The NexStar SE mount has motors with encoders on both axes and a hand controller with 38,181 objects in the database. To initialize the computer control, all you have to do is enter the time and location (selectable from the database) into the hand controller and move to any three bright celestial objects - it doesn't matter which ones, you don't even have to know them! After this SkyAlign, the mount knows what the sky above it looks like and controls each additional object at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>With the optional Celestron SkySync GPS module, you save yourself the trouble of entering the date, time and observation location, making setup even easier. This data is automatically transferred to the telescope via the GPS satellites.</p>
<p>The SE telescopes are also compatible with the StarSense module. Behind this is a small camera that is mounted on the telescope and uses to orient the telescope fully automatically in the sky - without GPS. With StarSense, all you have to do is set up the telescope, switch it on and wait about three minutes. Since StarSense is compatible with all modern, computer-controlled Celestron telescopes, you can continue to use it even if you ever buy a larger telescope - StarSense also works with observatory-class telescopes.</p>
<p>This means that a NexStar SE telescope can be updated at any time when there are technical innovations - this ensures that your telescope retains its value!</p>
<p><em>Control via PC and iPhone:</em><br>Like all Celestron NexStar telescopes, the NexStar SE can also be controlled via PC. All you need is the optional Celestron RS cable and, if necessary, an adapter from RS232 to USB. You can then control the telescope from a Windows PC using the NexRemote software or the widely used ASCOM interface.</p>
<p>But the SE telescopes also support wireless control! You can control the telescope wirelessly using the optional SkyQ Link WLAN adapter - either via a Windows PC or via iPhone or iPad (with the optional SkyQ planetarium program). This means you don't have to take a laptop with you on your observation nights, an iPhone is enough, and you have a modern graphic telescope control in addition to the hand controller.</p>
<p><strong>Well thought-out mount:</strong><br>The mount of the Celestron NexStar SE telescopes is a solid azimuthal single-arm mount that can be set up without tools. The large, easy-to-grip screws mean that this can also be done with gloves. The sturdy steel tripod has a shelf for accessories and a holder for the hand control box. The SE mount can carry devices weighing up to approx. 5.5kg, depending on the design. The clamping device on the arm of the mount fits any standardized Vixen (V) dovetail and holds it securely.</p>
<p>The hand controller is neatly integrated into the fork arm and can be removed if necessary. The telescope can also be operated comfortably when it is in the fork arm holder.</p>
<p><strong>Power supply:</strong><br>The computer control is of course dependent on electricity. The mount offers several options for power supply: Either via eight standard AA batteries if you want to be completely independent, or via an optional connection cable for the cigarette lighter socket of a car or via an optional power supply unit. The battery compartment integrated into the mount avoids cable clutter and enables maximum mobility.</p>
<p><strong>* Important: Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong></p>
<p>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case.</p>

SK0000028-UK,Bresser Messier AR-127L/635 EXOS-2 PMC 8,"<p><strong>The Bresser Messier AR-127S/635 tube with its compact design offers particularly large and bright fields of view making it ideal for Astrophotography.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Telescope:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the large aperture, the Messier AR-127S/635 can use nebula filters that enhance gas nebulae with remarkable contrast. The special construction consists of a four-lens achromat which achieves minimal color error and better photographic correction than comparable two-lens devices, even with a very fast focal ratio of f/5 for a refractor. </p>
<p>With the high-quality solar filter, you can safely observe sunspots, eclipses, and planetary transits. (Warning: Never point the telescope at the sun without a solar filter.)<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The EXOS-2 PMC-Eight Mount:</strong></p>
<p>The Explore Scientific EXOS-2 PMC-Eight GoTo Mount is equipped with a modern and very precise GoTo control system. It consists of a robust Wi-Fi controller unit that provides all the necessary interfaces. The NEMA-11 stepper motors are directly connected to this unit via cable, and an ST-4 compatible autoguider interface is also available. In addition, the control system supports micro-stepping to ensure precise tracking.</p>
<p><em>Intuitive operation via app and graphical star chart:</em><br>The ExploreStars App, developed specifically for the PMC-Eight system, impresses with a very well-designed, intuitive user interface. The featured 'alignment stars' for initializing the control system, as well as all celestial objects in the database, are displayed as a star chart with additional text information. All these objects can be easily viewed and selected.</p>
<p><em>Powerful controller unit with Open GoTo for customization:</em><br>The heart of the controller unit consists of a completely autonomous 2-channel multi-processor with 8 CPUs and a Wi-Fi Ethernet 10/100 adapter with IP function. This allows remote operation via browser, ASCOM, app, or serial connection. The Open GoTo also allows you to write your own firmware and upload it to the controller unit. This enables custom adjustments to the device’s functions as well as the creation of custom object lists, etc.</p>
<p><em>Polar finder included:</em><br>The included and pre-installed polar finder scope allows for quick and precise polar alignment for longer exposure times without star trails. The integrated LED lighting unit further enhances the comfort of using the polar finder.</p>

SK0000029-UK,Celestron NexStar - 8SE,"<p><strong>Each Celestron Nexstar SE telescope is exceptionally easy to use and offers all the conveniences of a modern, computerized telescope that can automatically locate over 38,000 objects and even suggests which celestial objects are best observed from your location at the moment. They are also suitable for even getting started in astrophotography.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the powerful SkyAlign technology, setting up the telescope correctly to find even the most difficult galaxies is no longer a problem. Simply point the telescope at three stars and it will be ready for use in no time. This gives you an exceptionally affordable telescope with a range of features that previous generations of amateur astronomers could only have dreamed of (Note: you only need to see the three ""guide stars"", you don't need to know them).</p>
<p>You can even remotely control this telescope with your iPhone, iPad or Windows PC via WiFi using the optional SkyQ-Link WiFi adapter and the SkyQ app, which is available separately from the Apple AppStore - simply use the star map on the screen. So if you are looking for a telescope with the most modern control electronics, then choose the Celestron NexStar SE. With the optional StarSense module, the telescope even takes over the initialization in the starry sky itself - all you have to do is set up the telescope, switch it on and wait three minutes.</p>
<p><em>The NexStar 8SE - the lightweight all-rounder for deep sky and planets:</em><br>The NexStar 8SE is the middle to higher range Schmidt-Cassegrain in the NexStar SE series with an 8"" aperture. It is the ideal compromise between portability and performance - with this aperture, globular clusters are very well resolved and brighter galaxies and nebulae start to show more detail under dark skies. Near cities, nebula filters can be used to help block out the scattered light from cities.</p>
<p>The telescope has the 1.25"" focuser connection that is common in astronomy. This means that all common astronomical 1.25"" eyepieces (plug size: 31.7mm) can be used which covers all useful magnifications and enables quick switching between different magnifications. Adapters are also available to use 2"" eyepieces and accessories.</p>
<p>SLR cameras and numerous other accessories can also be connected using a separately available T-adapter. The T-thread is a standard item that can be used to connect almost any accessory - from SLR cameras to binocular attachments.</p>
<p><em>The NexStar 6/8SE mount:</em><br>The mount of the 6SE and 8SE telescopes are larger and more stable than the mount of the smaller models. This azimuthal single-arm mount is optimized to be ready for use quickly and easy to transport. Unlike the classic parallactic mount, you do not have to spend time aligning the telescope to the north, setting the polar height or taking counterweights with you. The mount is simply set up horizontally and after alignment (in which you simply set any three bright stars), the computer automatically ensures that the telescope moves to the desired objects and keeps them in the eyepiece: the automatic tracking automatically compensates for the rotation of the earth.</p>
<p>This makes the SE telescopes ideal for anyone who wants to observe the starry sky themselves: very portable, quickly ready for use and with all the necessary comfort.</p>
<p>The telescope is attached to the mount with a standard prism rail with quick coupling, so it can be easily removed. The mount can also provide stable support for other telescopes up to approx. 5.5kg. However, this is not necessary for transport: the complete mount including telescope is very handy and fits, for example, in the separately available, padded transport case. It is simply attached to the stable steel tripod with three easy-to-grip screws; a centering pin helps when placing it on the tripod.</p>
<p>The NexStar 6/8SE mount also offers everything you need for photography: lunar photography with an SLR camera or planetary photography with a video camera are also possible without any problems in azimuthal operation with the correct camera adapter. Long exposures are also possible using the optional Heavy Duty Deluxe polar wedge: The mount is aligned parallel to the earth's axis, like a classic parallactic (""astronomical"") mount. </p>
<p>A software installed in the hand controller helps you to easily align the mount with high precision even without a polar finder. This not only prevents the image field from rotating when you photograph for example a lunar eclipse over a long period of time but also allows deep sky imaging. An AUX connection enables the connection of additional accessories - from GPS receivers to StarSense modules.</p>
<p><em>Comprehensive star catalogs and TOUR function for an overview:</em><br>The hand controller contains a database with over 38,000 objects. These include, of course, the planets of the solar system as well as countless galaxies, gas nebulae, star clusters and interesting stars. Are you having trouble choosing? Then use the TOUR mode, which shows you a selection of the most beautiful objects every evening and explains them on the display.</p>
<p><em>SkyAlign - Setup without knowledge of the sky:</em><br>The NexStar SE mount has motors with encoders on both axes and a hand controller with 38,181 objects in the database. To initialize the computer control, all you have to do is enter the time and location (selectable from the database) into the hand controller and move to any three bright celestial objects - it doesn't matter which ones, you don't even have to know them! After this SkyAlign, the mount knows what the sky above it looks like and controls each additional object at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>With the optional Celestron SkySync GPS module, you save yourself the trouble of entering the date, time and observation location, making setup even easier. This data is automatically transferred to the telescope via the GPS satellites.</p>
<p>The SE telescopes are also compatible with the StarSense module. Behind this is a small camera that is mounted on the telescope and uses to orient the telescope fully automatically in the sky - without GPS. With StarSense, all you have to do is set up the telescope, switch it on and wait about three minutes. Since StarSense is compatible with all modern, computer-controlled Celestron telescopes, you can continue to use it even if you ever buy a larger telescope - StarSense also works with observatory-class telescopes.</p>
<p>This means that a NexStar SE telescope can be updated at any time when there are technical innovations - this ensures that your telescope retains its value!</p>
<p><em>Control via PC and iPhone:</em><br>Like all Celestron NexStar telescopes, the NexStar SE can also be controlled via PC. All you need is the optional Celestron RS cable and, if necessary, an adapter from RS232 to USB. You can then control the telescope from a Windows PC using the NexRemote software or the widely used ASCOM interface.</p>
<p>But the SE telescopes also support wireless control! You can control the telescope wirelessly using the optional SkyQ Link WLAN adapter - either via a Windows PC or via iPhone or iPad (with the optional SkyQ planetarium program). This means you don't have to take a laptop with you on your observation nights, an iPhone is enough, and you have a modern graphic telescope control in addition to the hand controller.</p>
<p><strong>Well thought-out mount:</strong><br>The mount of the Celestron NexStar SE telescopes is a solid azimuthal single-arm mount that can be set up without tools. The large, easy-to-grip screws mean that this can also be done with gloves. The sturdy steel tripod has a shelf for accessories and a holder for the hand control box. The SE mount can carry devices weighing up to approx. 5.5kg, depending on the design. The clamping device on the arm of the mount fits any standardized Vixen (V) dovetail and holds it securely.</p>
<p>The hand controller is neatly integrated into the fork arm and can be removed if necessary. The telescope can also be operated comfortably when it is in the fork arm holder.</p>
<p><strong>Power supply:</strong><br>The computer control is of course dependent on electricity. The mount offers several options for power supply: Either via eight standard AA batteries if you want to be completely independent, or via an optional connection cable for the cigarette lighter socket of a car or via an optional power supply unit. The battery compartment integrated into the mount avoids cable clutter and enables maximum mobility.</p>
<p><strong>* Important: Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong></p>
<p>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case.</p>

SK0000030-UK,Bresser Messier MC-152/1900 EXOS-2 PMC 8,"<p><strong>The Bresser Messier MC-152 Maksutov-Cassegrain excells at detailed lunar and planetary observations and astrophotography. One of the main advantages of the Maksutov design is its robustness and compact size, making it ideal for trips to dark sky locations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Telescope:</strong></p>
<p>The compact optics define the Messier MC-150 and its short physical length make it ideal for mobile use. With the very long 1900mm focal length, you can look forward to exciting planetary observations at high magnifications. The 150mm aperture allows you to observe smaller nebulae in the vastness of space. Find the remnants of a massive star explosion from 1054 in the constellation Taurus, or trace the glowing filaments of the Great Orion Nebula. Spot the famous Whirlpool Galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major, or find the Dumbbell Nebula in the constellation Vulpecula. Additionally, the high-quality objective solar filter enables safe observations of sunspots, eclipses, and planetary transits. (Caution: Never point the telescope at the sun without the solar filter!)</p>
<p><strong>The EXOS-2 PMC-Eight Mount:</strong></p>
<p>The Explore Scientific EXOS-2 PMC-Eight GoTo Mount is equipped with a modern and very precise GoTo control system. It consists of a robust Wi-Fi controller unit that provides all the necessary interfaces. The NEMA-11 stepper motors are directly connected to this unit via cable, and an ST-4 compatible autoguider interface is also available. In addition, the control system supports micro-stepping to ensure precise tracking.</p>
<p><em>Intuitive operation via app and graphical star chart:</em><br>The ExploreStars App, developed specifically for the PMC-Eight system, impresses with a very well-designed, intuitive user interface. The featured 'alignment stars' for initializing the control system, as well as all celestial objects in the database, are displayed as a star chart with additional text information. All these objects can be easily viewed and selected.</p>
<p><em>Powerful controller unit with Open GoTo for customization:</em><br>The heart of the controller unit consists of a completely autonomous 2-channel multi-processor with 8 CPUs and a Wi-Fi Ethernet 10/100 adapter with IP function. This allows remote operation via browser, ASCOM, app, or serial connection. The Open GoTo also allows you to write your own firmware and upload it to the controller unit. This enables custom adjustments to the device’s functions as well as the creation of custom object lists, etc.</p>
<p><em>Polar finder included:</em><br>The included and pre-installed polar finder scope allows for quick and precise polar alignment for longer exposure times without star trails. The integrated LED lighting unit further enhances the comfort of using the polar finder.<br></p>

SK0000032-UK,"Bresser Messier 305 Dobsonian Telescope - 12""","<p><strong>The Bresser Messier 12"" Dobsonian really does take your Astronomy journey to another level. This well loved telescope series even provides good portability due to its lightweight fibreglass telescope tube and optics of this size offer some of the best views you will see of our Solar System and beyond.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the powerful telescope aperture of 305mm, you get significantly more light-gathering capacity than with the smaller models and are therefore not limited to observing the moon and the planets of our solar system - you can already look far out into the universe and observe globular clusters, nebulae and galaxies with even greater brightness. Details become visible in most deep-sky objects: globular clusters are clearly resolved into individual stars and gas nebulae, which can only be guessed at with smaller devices, show structure. </p>
<p>The device is unrivalled in its versatility: The excellent large Hexafoc focuser has an aperture of 65mm - so there is no noticeable obstruction from the focuser tube even with large wide-field eyepieces. </p>
<p>Thanks to the large altitude wheels, even these heavier eyepieces are held effortlessly. And if a particularly large number of accessories is attached, such as a binocular attachment, then the entire tube can be moved inside the tube clamps - and everything is balanced again in a flash. The unrivalled rigidity of the focuser makes focusing very easy - so photography with this telescope is also possible. </p>
<p>This is another strength of this universal telescope: if you want to take photos, you can simply unscrew the altitude wheels from the tube and attach it to an equatorial mount using a dovetail bar - so there's nothing standing in the way of astrophotography. An optional 10:1 gear reduction for the focuser is available for the highest demands. Considering that the focuser is the most frequently used part of the telescope, the use of the Hexafoc in this device is a quantum leap for this price range. </p>
<p>In addition, the new 12"" Bresser Messier makes it easy to transport the device as compactly as possible - the rocker box can be dismantled in a few simple steps because the parts are assembled with metal quick-release connectors. This quickly turns a bulky rocker box into a handy flat package of individual parts. This really is a telescope whose versatility, performance and user-friendliness set new standards in this price class. </p>
<p>The package also includes a high-quality objective solar filter for safe observation of sunspots, eclipses and planetary transits.</p>

SK0000034-UK,Celestron Origin - Smart Telescope,"<p><strong>The Celestron Origin Intelligent Home Observatory is at the forefront of a new era in amateur astronomy, combining stargazing and astrophotography into a single, user-friendly experience. </strong></p>
<p>EAA (Electronically Aided/Assisted Astronomy) combines modern camera technology with live observation of the sky. This smart telescope takes care of the complex technicalities of modern telescopes for you, transforming your backyard into a gateway to the cosmos. Equipped with cutting-edge technology and user-friendly operation, Celestron Origin captures the beauty of celestial objects and wirelessly transmits them to your tablet, smartphone, or even a TV screen.</p>
<p>Celestron engineers applied their decades of experience to every technical detail, from the patented optics to an intuitive control app. The result is a revolutionary, ground-up system that builds on Celestron's long-standing heritage and experience, making astronomy more accessible, exciting, and fun than ever before.<br><br><strong>RASA optical technology:</strong><br>At the heart of the Celestron Origin lies the patented Rowe-Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph (RASA ) - a milestone in optics development. The RASA design places the image sensor at the front of the telescope, not the back, resulting in an extremely fast f/2.2 system with an exceptionally wide field of view while enabling sharp images right to the edge. Since its introduction in 2014, RASA technology has become the first choice for space surveillance and satellite tracking. Companies, researchers, and governments rely on RASA telescopes to do things like scan the skies for dangerous, tiny pieces of satellite debris that could destroy our vital communications satellites. For the Origin, Celestron engineers developed a brand-new 6-inch RASA that offers all the capabilities of an observatory-grade instrument in a portable package.</p>
<p>Thanks to RASA optics, the Origin is in a class of its own among smart telescopes, far surpassing other telescope designs. A RASA collects more light in less time than a smaller and slower Newtonian reflector, refractor, or other entry-level telescopes. The unique combination of fast image acquisition, aperture, and therefore detail resolution defines the RASA's performance. In short, it delivers unparalleled detail in photos while maintaining short exposure times.</p>
<p>To fully utilize the RASA optics, Celestron selected the Sony IMX178 color CMOS sensor for image capture. It features STARVIS back-illuminated technology for maximum sensitivity and fast readout with low noise, also contributing to fast image acquisition and high sharpness. This sensitive chip features small 2.4µm pixels for high resolution—perfect for the fast optical design.</p>
<p><strong>Now everyone can become a real astrophotographer:</strong><br>Celestron Origin, with its built-in AI algorithms, represents a paradigm shift in sophisticated astrophotography. As the telescope acquires data, these intelligent algorithms automatically stack and process each  image in real time. The result is a stunning display of celestial objects, in color and with a wealth of detail only seen in images taken by experienced astrophotographers. For the first time, astrophotography is accessible to enthusiasts of all experience levels, including those who have never used a telescope before.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Celestron Origin Smart Telescope:</strong><br>A universe in your hands: StarSense technology &amp; the Origin app<br>Setting up the Celestron Origin is a breeze thanks to the automated initialization process powered by StarSense technology. Place the Origin under a clear night sky, turn it on, and connect it to the app. Then you can decide whether to stay with your telescope or head indoors. In less than two minutes, the Origin focuses itself, scans the night sky, self-orients itself by comparing star patterns with its internal database, and notifies you that it's ready to use.</p>
<p>The Celestron Origin app , developed in collaboration with Simulation Curriculum, the creators of SkySafari™, offers an intuitive planetarium interface that simplifies navigating the night sky. Use the planetarium view, point your device at the sky, and look around in ""Compass Mode,"" then simply tap on any object you want to see (the most beautiful ones are highlighted). Or try the ""Tonight's Best"" list, where Origin displays all the most impressive galaxies, nebulae, star clusters, and more—based on your exact location and time of observation. Never again will you need to consult a star atlas or plan ahead; Origin is ready to show you the universe, even if clear skies catch you off guard.</p>
<p>Once you select a target, the Origin precisely centers it in the field of view. Switch to the camera view and press ""Start Imaging"" to begin capturing 10-second exposures. It couldn't be easier! You'll see in real time how the summed photos reveal increasing detail. As the Origin works, it continuously tracks the sky and adjusts its built-in dew protection system and fans to the ambient conditions, ensuring the optics are optimally tempered for razor-sharp images.</p>
<p><strong>A shared cosmic experience:</strong><br>With Origin, no one has to wait their turn to look through an eyepiece. Whether your friends and family are gathered in the same room or outdoors,  multiple people can connect to Origin and view the live image on their own devices . Origin also lets you stream the live feed to your smart TV or instantly save and share your astrophotography, creating unforgettable moments beyond your viewing spot.</p>
<p><strong>Ready for more? Advanced features:</strong><br>As your interest in the hobby grows, you'll be able to take advantage of more advanced features and capabilities. For example, Origin has a built-in filter drawer that accepts standard 1.25"" and 2"" filters. This allows you to optionally install astronomical filters, which are especially useful when photographing nebulae in light-polluted environments, such as typical suburban gardens. For imaging broadband objects such as galaxies and star clusters, or objects under dark skies, remove the filter for more light transmission and brighter images. Experiment with different and interchangeable filters to achieve results you can't achieve with the fixed filters of other systems.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try advanced image processing, that's also possible. Origin saves all your raw images for you. Connect via USB to import them into your favorite image editing software for manual editing and stacking.</p>
<p>And how about letting Origin work for you while you sleep? It's easy with the Scheduled Observations feature. Simply tell the app which objects you want to capture. When you wake up, you'll be greeted by spectacular images.</p>
<p><strong>Take your astrophotography studio anywhere:</strong><br>Celestron Origin is a portable system that doesn't require external Wi-Fi networks, so you can easily take it with you in any car to distant dark skies. The optical tube, mount, and tripod all assemble and disassemble easily without tools. Each component weighs less than 7 kg.<br><br><strong>Your Origin system comes complete with everything you need to get started right away including: </strong></p>

SK0000035-UK,"Explore Scientific 305 Dobsonian Telescope - 12""","<p><strong>Explore Scientific Ultra Light Dobson 254mm Telescope - GENERATION II</strong><br><br>No type of telescope has changed amateur astronomy as much as the Dobsonian design telescopes. Before John Dobson introduced the Dobson telescope, the vast majority of amateur telescopes consisted of small lens telescopes with primitive mechanics - just enough to barely make out the polar caps of Mars or the rings of Saturn. Larger telescopes, such as Schmidt-Cassegrains, were reserved for a much more expensive and specialised market, however this all changed with the introduction of the Dobsonian Telescope. The Dobsonian design combines simple but effective mechanics with the largest possible aperture, which has given the Dobsonian telescope a unique triumph worldwide. Nowhere else do you get so much light gathering ability for your money as with a good Dobsonian Telescope.<br><br>At 305mm (12"") Aperture things start to get very serious in terms of what you can see through the eyepiece. The Moon and Planets are simply awe inspiring and even fainter objects like Galaxies and nebula start to show lots of real detail and structure - Particularly if you are viewing from a dark sky location. A telescope with a mirror diameter of 305mm collects more than 1800 times as much light than the naked eye.<br><br>The easy disassembly of this telescope allows for problem-free transport, even in relatively small cars - the assembly then is quick and easy without the need for tools. The entire construction has been optimized for maximum stiffness without neglecting weight. The combination of large height wheels with an optimized aluminum sandwich construction enables the finest correction movements at the highest magnifications. The focus position has already been prepared for the use of a coma corrector. <br><br><strong>Transport dimensions for mobile use:</strong><br></p>

SK0000036-UK,"Bresser Messier 203 Dobsonian Telescope - 8""","<p><strong>The Bresser Messier 8"" Dobsonian offers the performance and qualities rivaling many other more expensive telescopes, infact there are many dedicated Dobsonian telescope users groups, passionate about these designs and given the outstanding performance of these telescopes and their price, its easy to see why. </strong></p>
<p>The optical diameter of 203mm (8"") does not limit your observations to solar system objects such as the moon or the planets - These telescope designs allow you to reach much further into deep space and explore globular / open star clusters, nebulae and galaxies.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">With a Telescope of this aperture objects are beginning to show some structure: globular clusters are no longer only fuzzy circles, but are resolved into masses of individual stars. Nebulae, that can only be barely detected in smaller scopes, start to reveal structures within. The excellent Hexafoc focuser boosts a large 2.5"" diameter so that you don't have vignetting in big widefield eyepieces that can occur in smaller focuser barrels.</p>
<p>The big altitude wheels handle the large heavy optics without issue - and if you decide to use even larger accessories (like a bino-viewer with two eyepieces) then you can move the tube in its tube rings and achieve balance within seconds. If you need to transport or store the telescope, the rocker box disassembles (and re-assembles) very easily.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>Telescope Specs:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""></p>

SK0000037-UK,Celestron AVX - C9.25,"<p><strong>The AVX-C9.25 combines the quality optics of a Celestron 9.25 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope with the computer-controlled equatorial Advanced-VX mount, providing an affordable entry into astrophotography.</strong></p>
<p>The 9.25"" was specifically designed for observations with 2"" eyepieces and has an optimized aperture system to minimize vignetting at the edge of the field of view when photographing. Its primary mirror with a longer focal length and the secondary mirror with a lower magnification enable a flatter image and reduce optical aberrations.</p>
<p>The adjustable counterweight allows you to easily balance the telescope. The optics deliver clear images thanks to the StarBright XLT coating and collect 33% more light than the 8"" model. The optimized aperture system increases contrast when observing planets and is an advantage when doing astrophotography. An optional polar finder scope and the software routine of the hand control box make it easier to align to the north.</p>
<p>The Advanced VX is designed as an ideal platform for astrophotography with smaller telescopes. For telescopes up to approx. 13.6kg (depending on the lever), the sophisticated functions of this large parallactic mount is now also available. Thanks to PEC (Periodic Error Correction), the periodic worm error that occurs in all mounts with classic worm gears can be compensated, so that long-exposure shots are easily carried out. You can also track objects far beyond the meridian without having to immediately turn carry out a meridian flip. This means you can observe the most interesting part of the sky without interruption. The Advanced VX also has a much wider base than its predecessor, which further increases stability even with large loads. The improved motors have a higher torque and can better compensate for slight imbalances.</p>
<p>Since spring 2019, it has been delivered with the dual dovetail clamp , so that both telescopes with the small CG5 rail (EQ standard) and the large CGE rail (3"" standard) fit on the AVX - without additional adapters! All you have to do is move the clamping screws. Larger telescopes in particular benefit from the wider rail, which offers more stability.</p>
<p><em>Third-party dovetail plates:</em><br>The Advanced VX is still compatible with Vixen format dovetail rails. However, the rail must be at least 100mm long as the clamping points on the new AVX are 90mm apart. If a user wants to use the AVX with a telescope that has a Vixen (or CG-5) dovetail rail that is shorter than 100mm, the rail must be replaced with a longer dovetail rail however suitable rails are available separately.</p>
<p>The new AVX mount is not compatible with Losmandy D format dovetail rails. The CGE and Losmandy D formats are similar but not identical. Losmandy rails are about a millimeter wider, while CGE plates are deeper and have more surface contact with the dovetail clamp. To use an AVX with a telescope with a Losmandy D dovetail rail, the existing rail must also be replaced with a compatible dovetail rail.</p>
<p><em>State-of-the-art technology for mobile use:</em><br>Celestron Advanced VX mounts set a new standard for medium-sized telescopes up to 13.6kg. The mount was developed from scratch, always with astrophotography in mind. It offers many of the features of the large Celestron mounts at a very attractive price.</p>
<p><em>Solid cast parts and heavy-duty mechanics:</em><br>Based on the proven Advanced GT mount, the Advanced VX not only offers large, easy-to-grip adjustment screws and more powerful motors that can cope even better with unevenly distributed loads, but also a wider base for the tripod connection and an improved dual dovetail mount with two clamping screws. No premature tilting! Tracking is possible up to 20° beyond the meridian passage.</p>
<p><em>State-of-the-art software:</em><br>The AVX mount is supplied with the cold-resistant, much more powerful NexStar+ hand controller. This means you have a modern computer control system at your disposal - with over 40,000 objects stored. Thanks to the built-in clock, setup is even faster than before. The software automatically moves to the reference stars, you only have to center them in the eyepiece.</p>
<p>Advanced VX mounts can be controlled via Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software via the PC connection on the hand controller</p>
<p><em>Orientation made easy:</em><br>With the AVX, you no longer have to laboriously adjust the North Star using the polar finder scope: Align the mount roughly to the north, perform a 2-star alignment - and then call up the All-Star Polar Alignment. The software now helps you to align the mount precisely to the north, even if you cannot see the North Star. You can look comfortably through the telescope and do not have to kneel under the polar finder scope (which is still available as an option).</p>
<p><em>Versatile &amp; Future proof:</em><br>In addition to an RS232 port, the AVX also has an autoguider input and two AUX ports. Here you can connect additional, separately available expansion modules - for example the SkyPortal WiFi module for control via WLAN with iPhone/iPad/Windows PC or the StarSense module, with which the mount automatically moves to its reference stars and centers them perfectly.</p>
<p>Experienced photographers will appreciate how easily this mount can be transported to a dark observing site. If you are new to astronomy or astrophotography, the Advanced VX will make it easy to get started and will serve you well for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong><br>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case. We also have a range of power supply adapters available for these mounts and many others, just contact us.</p>

SK0000038-UK,"Celestron StarSense Explorer - 8"" Dobsonian","<p><strong>Celestron has reinvented the manual telescope with the StarSense Explorer - the first telescope that uses your smartphone to analyze the night sky and calculate its position in real time. The StarSense Explorer is ideal for beginners thanks to its user-friendly interface and detailed tutorials. It's like having your own personal guide to the night sky.</strong></p>
<p><em>High quality azimuthal mount:</em><br>The Rockerbox, developed by Celestron, is an ultra-stable, aesthetically pleasing mount with Teflon azimuth bearings. Large 15cm diameter altitude bearings ensure smooth up and down movement. The altitude bearings have a ""braking system"" that allows the resistance to be adjusted to allow smooth movement even with slight imbalances. Bracing for the side panels provides additional stability and rigidity - a feature normally only seen on larger Dobsonians.</p>
<p>With the handle at the front of the tube you can move the telescope easily and sensitively.</p>
<p><em>High-quality optics for the perfect view into space:</em><br>With the large 8"" primary mirror, this Dobson has enough light gathering power to see impressive details in celestial objects. The highly reflective coating on both the primary and secondary mirrors provides sharp, bright images.</p>
<p>The primary and secondary mirrors are coated with StarBright XLT coating to increase contrast and light transmission. StarBright XLT reveals subtle details whether you are looking at the moon and planets or faint galaxies and nebulae. For more information on the patented StarBright XLT coatings, click  here .</p>
<p>This telescope is also equipped with a high-quality 2"" Crayford focuser . The Crayford system enables precise and smooth focusing without focus drift. The scope of delivery also includes a 2"" to 1.25"" reducer and a 2"" extension sleeve, so you can use virtually any 1.25"" or 2"" eyepiece on your StarSense Explorer Dobson. The focuser also has a locking screw that allows you to lock it in the sharpest position.</p>
<p><em>Ideal for every location:</em><br>Even if you live in a location with slightly bright skies and moderate light pollution, StarSense Explorer can locate Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, the Orion Nebula, binary stars, and many more of the most famous celestial objects.</p>
<p>From a darker location, you can see these objects better, and observe many other targets. From an aperture of 8"" deep sky observation is really fun, as many globular clusters can be clearly resolved into individual stars, and the first galaxies show details such as spiral arms. At the observation location, all you have to do is put the telescope in the mount, insert the eyepiece and smartphone, and start the app, and you can start observing! The eyepiece holder ensures that you always have all eyepieces within reach when observing.</p>
<p>The entire telescope weighs only 19.6kg, making it perfectly portable and easy to take with you on your next camping trip or to a remote observing site.</p>

SK0000039-UK,"Bresser Messier NT-203/800 EXOS-2 GOTO - 8""","<p><strong>For many years Bresser Newtonian telescopes have become the standard workhorse for Deep Sky astrophotography, now the second generation of this telescope, the Bresser NT-203s/800 comes with an improved Hexafoc focusser and fast parabolic main mirror. </strong></p>
<p>The Bresser NT-203s/800 f3.9 will deliver you much more detailed images at shorter exposures due to its oversized primary mirror and therefore faster optical system (f3.9, compared to standard f5 telescopes of this size). The large 85 mm secondary mirror also helps reduce vignetting for maximum optimal illumination of the target. The excellent 2,5"" Hexafoc focuser also helps reduce vignetting due to its large diameter and makes focussing a joy - the smoothness and shifting-free operation sets a new standard in this price class.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>BRESSER EXOS-2 GoTo Equatorial Mount:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">This German Equatorial Mount has tracking motors in both axes that follow celestial objects very smoothly and precisely. The hand controller with full GOTO abilities works reliably and is very user friendly - See Manual download below. Precision ball bearings in both axes help ensure minimal backlash at all nine possible tracking speeds and the 12V battery pack is conveniently fastened to the tripod shelf and takes eight size D batteries. The mount can also be powered using a mains or car plug adapter (sold seperately)<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>EXOS-2 GOTO System:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Startracker GoTo System enables beginners with little experience to start astronomical observations in just a few minutes, and guides you to various objects in the nigt sky that are not visible through the small finder scope. At the push of a button you can locate Planets, Nebulae or Galaxies in minutes. The database on the Startracker system holds thousands of celestial objects to choose from.<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Bresser StarTracker GoTo systems also uses servo motors for both axes and features an ST-4 compatible autoguiding input - essential for long exposure Astrophotography.

SK0000040-UK,"Explore Scientific 406 Dobsonian Telescope - 16""","<p><strong>Explore Scientific Ultra Light Dobson 406mm Telescope - GENERATION II</strong><br><br>No type of telescope has changed amateur astronomy as much as the Dobsonian design telescopes. Before John Dobson introduced the Dobson telescope, the vast majority of amateur telescopes consisted of small lens telescopes with primitive mechanics - just enough to barely make out the polar caps of Mars or the rings of Saturn. Larger telescopes, such as Schmidt-Cassegrains, were reserved for a much more expensive and specialised market, however this all changed with the introduction of the Dobsonian Telescope. The Dobsonian design combines simple but effective mechanics with the largest possible aperture, which has given the Dobsonian telescope a unique triumph worldwide. Nowhere else do you get so much light gathering ability for your money as with a good Dobsonian Telescope.<br><br>At 406mm (16"") Aperture things start to get very serious in terms of what you can see through the eyepiece. The Moon and Planets are simply incredible and even fainter objects like Galaxies and nebula start to show lots of real detail and structure as well as hints of colour - Particularly if you are viewing from a dark sky location. A telescope with a mirror diameter of 406mm collects more than 3300 times as much light than the naked eye.<br><br>The easy disassembly of this telescope allows for problem-free transport, even in relatively small cars - the assembly then is quick and easy without the need for tools. The entire construction has been optimized for maximum stiffness without neglecting weight. The combination of large height wheels with an optimized aluminum sandwich construction enables the finest correction movements at the highest magnifications. The focus position has already been prepared for the use of a coma corrector. <br><br><strong>Transport dimensions for mobile use:</strong><br></p>

SK0000042-UK,Celestron CPC 800 - GPS,"<p><strong>The CPC 800 GPS XLT is the portable fork-mounted top-class telescope from Celestron and features the StarBright XLT coating. The telescope is perfect for visual observations and, with an optional polar wedge and an astro camera, also enables professional astrophotography.</strong></p>
<p>If you point the telescope at the planets, you'll see fascinating details on the surface of Jupiter, the Cassini division of Saturn's rings, and surface details on Mars. Even Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are within your reach.</p>
<p>Despite the large aperture, the telescope is so portable thanks to the practical carrying handle and a weight of around 19kg so that you can set it up easily in your garden as well as in your favorite spot under a dark sky.</p>
<p><em>Professional XLT computer telescopes:</em><br>With the CPC series, Celestron is introducing the most stable fork mount that has ever been available in the 40 years of production of Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. The completely newly designed tripod and a huge 280mm ball bearing in the fork base enable vibration-free observation even at the highest magnifications.</p>
<p>The azimuthal fork mount is not as variable as the German mount, as it is tailored to the tube diameter. This disadvantage is compensated for by the compact design, low weight, good portability and, most importantly, incredibly quick setup. You are ready to observe in just a few minutes. Simply set up the tripod, level it with the built-in bubble level, put on the fork mount - and switch it on.</p>
<p><em>Built-in GPS:</em><br>The 16-channel GPS receiver transmits the time, date and location coordinates to the electronics. This means you no longer have to enter the time and location yourself - the telescope automatically has the exact data.</p>
<p><em>Sky Align:</em><br>This is the name of the brand new alignment process from Celestron for perfect GoTo positioning. The telescope no longer needs a defined base position: you place three bright stars (planets and the moon are also possible) in the field of view of the telescope one after the other and voilá, your CPC telescope is ready for automatic GoTo positioning on any object from the hand control database.</p>
<p>SkyAlign calculates the setup of your telescope from the travel distances of the three stars and the corresponding angles. SkyAlign also gets the other data required (date, time, and location coordinates) via the integrated 16-channel GPS receiver.</p>
<p>""SkyAlign"" only works when the telescope is in azimuthal operation, i.e. when the telescope is operated directly on the tripod without a polar wedge. But Celestron also has some new and simplified alignment methods for parallactic operation in the CPC series.</p>
<p><em>Extensive database:</em><br>The CPC telescope database contains over 40,000 celestial objects, including the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as galaxies and nebulae from the NGC catalog and the planets. You can narrow down your selection to make searching this comprehensive database easier and to hide objects that are currently below the horizon.</p>
<p>The ""Identify"" function tells you what you are currently seeing in the telescope and also allows you to easily explore the sky. Simply point the telescope at any area of ​​the sky and have it show you, for example, the nearest Messier objects - the telescope will navigate to them for you. You can do this in different areas of the sky and with different objects!</p>
<p><em>The CPC telescopes also score points with the following details:</em><br>The azimuthal fork mount has been completely redesigned. It is less susceptible to vibrations and the drive motors and gears run ""whisper quiet"" in GoTo mode. The tripod that supports the mount and telescope has also become more stable.<br>The completely newly designed tripod (landing pad) has a self-centering mounting device - no searching in the dark for the right attachment point for the mounting foot on the tripod. By rotating the mount on the tripod, the screw holes lock into the right position. Three spring-supported screws, which are anchored in the tripod, enable quick and, above all, effortless assembly in a matter of seconds. The built-in bubble level makes leveling easier. The large tripod triangle also serves as a storage area for several eyepieces.</p>
<p><em>Other features include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Illuminated on/off switch on the top of the housing - so no more searching in the dark,<br>
</li>
<li>Large, easy-to-grip clamping wheels (suitable for gloves) in both axles instead of fiddly small clamping levers,<br>
</li>
<li>The ""Permanent PEC"" function stores the periodic errors of the screw to improve the tracking accuracy,<br>
</li>
<li>The electronics work with all autoguiders and planetarium programs available on the market,<br>
</li>
<li>The ""Alignment Sync"" function allows you to improve positioning accuracy during operation by confirming a new alignment object,<br>
</li>
<li>The ""Precise Goto"" function allows very faint objects to be brought extremely precisely into the center of the field of view or a CCD chip. First, a bright star close to the object being searched for is selected by the electronics and moved to it. The observer must then move it precisely to the center of the field of view using the arrow keys on the hand controller. The computer then calculates the distance from this star to the object being searched for and moves to it with high precision.<br>
</li>
<li>Finally, another new ""feature"" of the hand controls of version 4.0 of the CPC series: thanks to a flash EPROM, the control and motor software can be upgraded via the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong><br>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case. Suitable high-quality power supplies can be found on the left under Optional Accessories.</p>

With the optical tube assembly of the CGEM II 1100 weighing only 12.5kg, this telescope is still portable enough to be taken to dark skies, and it has 89% more light gathering power than an 8"" telescope and more than 40% more than the 9.25"".</strong></p>
<p>This telescope is especially at home as a solid platform for long exposure photography with optional CCD cameras or photographic equipment; it is a serious scientific research tool that comes with Celestron's premium StarBright XLT coatings.</p>
<p>A fresh update to the venerable CGEM mount, the CGEM II has a fresh, attractive, bold appearance and is capable of carrying Celestron’s higher-end SCT optical tubes (up to 11"") securely and vibration free, which is ideal for both imaging and visual observing. Capable of holding 40 lbs. of payload and slewing at 5° per second, you will be able to instantly point to any of the celestial objects in the database.</p>
<p><em>Ergonomic Design:</em><br>CGEM II was designed to be ergonomically friendly with large Altitude and Azimuth adjustment knobs for quick and easy polar alignment adjustment. The internal RA and DEC motor wiring provides a clean look and an easy and trouble free set up.</p>
<p><em>Innovation:</em><br>The CGEM II series features Celestron’s innovative Polar alignment procedure called All-Star™. All-Star allows users to choose any bright star, while the software calculates and assists with polar alignment. Another great feature of the CGEM II sure to please astroimagers, is the Permanent Periodic Error Correction (PEC) which will allow users to train out the worm gears periodic errors, while the mount retains the PEC recordings.</p>
<p><em>Performance:<br></em>For objects near the Meridian (imaginary line passing from North to South), the CGEM II will track well past the Meridian for uninterrupted imaging through the most ideal part of the sky. The CGEM II mount has a robust database with over 40,000 objects, 100 user defined programmable objects and enhanced information on over 200 objects. Celestron's CGEM II mount is the perfect fit between the Advanced Series and CGE Series. Offering the portability of the Advanced Series and the precision of the CGE.</p>

SK0000044-UK,Celestron AVX - C8,"<p><strong>Celestron's C8 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes have been impressive for decades and owe their good reputation to the combination of excellent optics with a compact, lightweight design. The AVX-C8 is the perfect choice if you want to get started ""properly"" right away or want to afford a larger optic.</strong></p>
<p>The adjustable counterweight allows you to easily balance the telescope at any time. Thanks to the StarBright XLT coating, the optics deliver clear images and collect 843 times more light than the naked eye. An optional polar finder scope and the software routine of the hand control box make it easier to align the telescope north.</p>
<p>The Advanced VX is designed as an ideal platform for astrophotography with smaller telescopes. For telescopes up to approx. 13.6kg (depending on the lever), the sophisticated functions of this large parallactic mount is now also available. Thanks to PEC (Periodic Error Correction), the periodic worm error that occurs in all mounts with classic worm gears can be compensated, so that long-exposure shots are easily carried out. You can also track objects far beyond the meridian without having to immediately turn carry out a meridian flip. This means you can observe the most interesting part of the sky without interruption. The Advanced VX also has a much wider base than its predecessor, which further increases stability even with large loads. The improved motors have a higher torque and can better compensate for slight imbalances.</p>
<p>Since spring 2019, it has been delivered with the dual dovetail clamp , so that both telescopes with the small CG5 rail (EQ standard) and the large CGE rail (3"" standard) fit on the AVX - without additional adapters! All you have to do is move the clamping screws. Larger telescopes in particular benefit from the wider rail, which offers more stability.</p>
<p><em>Third-party dovetail plates:</em><br>The Advanced VX is still compatible with Vixen format dovetail rails. However, the rail must be at least 100mm long as the clamping points on the new AVX are 90mm apart. If a user wants to use the AVX with a telescope that has a Vixen (or CG-5) dovetail rail that is shorter than 100mm, the rail must be replaced with a longer dovetail rail however suitable rails are available separately.</p>
<p>The new AVX mount is not compatible with Losmandy D format dovetail rails. The CGE and Losmandy D formats are similar but not identical. Losmandy rails are about a millimeter wider, while CGE plates are deeper and have more surface contact with the dovetail clamp. To use an AVX with a telescope with a Losmandy D dovetail rail, the existing rail must also be replaced with a compatible dovetail rail.</p>
<p><em>State-of-the-art technology for mobile use:</em><br>Celestron Advanced VX mounts set a new standard for medium-sized telescopes up to 13.6kg. The mount was developed from scratch, always with astrophotography in mind. It offers many of the features of the large Celestron mounts at a very attractive price.</p>
<p><em>Solid cast parts and heavy-duty mechanics:</em><br>Based on the proven Advanced GT mount, the Advanced VX not only offers large, easy-to-grip adjustment screws and more powerful motors that can cope even better with unevenly distributed loads, but also a wider base for the tripod connection and an improved dual dovetail mount with two clamping screws. No premature tilting! Tracking is possible up to 20° beyond the meridian passage.</p>
<p><em>State-of-the-art software:</em><br>The AVX mount is supplied with the cold-resistant, much more powerful NexStar+ hand controller. This means you have a modern computer control system at your disposal - with over 40,000 objects stored. Thanks to the built-in clock, setup is even faster than before. The software automatically moves to the reference stars, you only have to center them in the eyepiece.</p>
<p>Advanced VX mounts can be controlled via Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software via the PC connection on the hand controller</p>
<p><em>Orientation made easy:</em><br>With the AVX, you no longer have to laboriously adjust the North Star using the polar finder scope: Align the mount roughly to the north, perform a 2-star alignment - and then call up the All-Star Polar Alignment. The software now helps you to align the mount precisely to the north, even if you cannot see the North Star. You can look comfortably through the telescope and do not have to kneel under the polar finder scope (which is still available as an option).</p>
<p><em>Versatile &amp; Future proof:</em><br>In addition to an RS232 port, the AVX also has an autoguider input and two AUX ports. Here you can connect additional, separately available expansion modules - for example the SkyPortal WiFi module for control via WLAN with iPhone/iPad/Windows PC or the StarSense module, with which the mount automatically moves to its reference stars and centers them perfectly.</p>
<p>Experienced photographers will appreciate how easily this mount can be transported to a dark observing site. If you are new to astronomy or astrophotography, the Advanced VX will make it easy to get started and will serve you well for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong><br>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case. We also have a range of power supply adapters available for these mounts and many others, just contact us.</p>

SK0000046-UK,"TS-Optics UNC f/6 Newtonian - 8""","<p><strong>The TS Optics UNC Newtonian series offers an alternative to Newtonians made in the far east. With these telescopes you do not have to settle for any compromises. UNC stands for Universal Newtonian telescope with Carbon tube. Each UNC Newtonian is individually manufactured for you in Germany.</strong></p>
<p>The 8"" f/6 UNC Newtonian is a specialist for moon and planets but also good for deep-sky observing. For the moon and planets only the atmosphere limits the resolution of the telescope, as the regular small secondary mirror provides a high contrast due to the low obstruction of only 25%.</p>
<p>Deep sky images with high detail resolution and high contrast, typically common with high quality APO Refractors, are also within your reach as the secondary mirror offers 100% illumination at 19mm. With flats, sensors up to APS-C format can be used.</p>
<p><em>The advantages of the TS UNC Newtonian telescopes:</em><br></p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality, German-made high quality carbon tube.<br>
</li>
<li>Easy collimation of primary and secondary mirror - by hand, without tools.<br>
</li>
<li>The edge of the secondary mirror is blackened.<br>
</li>
<li>TS UNCN2-G2 2"" rack and pinion focuser with M54x0.75 intermediate thread.<br>
</li>
<li>The secondary is Pre-attached to the secondary mount with the correct offset.<br>
</li>
<li>94% reflectivity on primary mirror and secondary mirror for a brighter image<br>
</li>
<li>Diffraction limited primary mirror - each telescope is tested on an optical bench before shipment</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The carbon tube - finest precision work:</em><br>The carbon tube is extra solid and completely reinforced, not only around the focuser. This makes the tubes much stiffer and the adjustment stability is high. The openings for the secondary are precisely fitted with turned mating parts, ensuring that the secondary spider vanes are correct and the telescope produces perfect spikes right from the start.</p>
<p><em>Focus position optimized for astrophotography:</em><br>The focus point is 135mm above the tube. This allows you to use different focusers and still have a comfortable working distance. With the standard focuser UNCN2-G2 you even get 80mm working distance, this even allows the use of focal reducers or a binoviewer with moderate glass path compensation. For standard correctors we recommend a 20mm spacer, which sits between the focuser. This gives you 60mm backfocus.</p>
<p>Note: For visual observation you need a 2"" extension tube - <a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://www.horizonastronomy.ie/collections/astrophotography-accessories/products/ts-optics-2-extension-tube-35mm"" target=""_blank"">Click here</a>.</p>
<p><em>The 2"" TS UNCN2-G2 RAP focuser:</em><br></p>
<ul>
<li>A core component of the TS UNC-Newtons is the modern TS UNCN2-G2 focuser. The focuser builds up only 58mm from the tube edge and still carries heavy cameras and accessories without tilting. The focuser is superior to conventional Crayford focusers.<br>
</li>
<li>High stiffness with extremely short length<br>
</li>
<li>Exact 1:10 dual-speed gear - for perfectly focused astrophotographs<br>Adjustment is decoupled from the ball bearing - a clear advantage over Crayford focusers<br>
</li>
<li>Threaded connection of accessories is possible - the 2"" receptacle can be unscrewed, then an M54x0.75 female thread is available.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Parabolic primary mirror:</em><br>Newtonian primary mirrors made of fused silica are free of strain and provide an image that is usually much better than diffraction limited types. The surface is coated with an enhanced 94% reflection layer and a protective quartz layer. The primary mirror has a central marking as an adjustment aid.</p>
<p><em>Primary mirror fan for faster cool-down time:</em><br>A cooling fan to accelerate cool-down time to ambient temperature. Until a mirror is properly cooled down, it will create currents of warm air that will deteriorate the image - no matter which mirror substrate is used. Only after the mirror has cooled down does this effect stop.</p>
<p><em>Every TS Carbon Newtonian is tested on our optical bench before shipping:</em><br>These are a solid telescope for life. After assembly, Each UNC Newtonian is subjected to an optical test at the workshop before shipping. This ensures that the telescope will fit your accessories perfectly and will deliver the optical performance promised.</p>
<p>Before shipping, the primary mirror with the cell is removed from the tube and packed separately. This is to guarantee a safe shipment and avoid unnecessary transport damages.</p>
<p><em>Choose your focus positions and change of secondary mirror diameter:</em><br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(37, 163, 34);""><strong>Focus position No.1</strong></span> - with 60mm above the 2"" receptacle has proven to be very versatile. Nevertheless, we can also offer you individual focus positions and other secondary mirror sizes - Just contact us prior to purchase.<br>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(37, 163, 34);""><strong>Focus position No.2</strong></span> - 30mm above the 2"" connection - optimal for visual observation. The secondary mirror can be slightly smaller, we recommend a secondary mirror with 63mm (minor axis) which is sufficient even for 2"" eyepieces.<br>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(37, 163, 34);""><strong>Focus position No.3</strong></span> - 90mm above the 2"" connection - this allows you to use a 0.73x reducer/corrector and change the focal ratio from f/6 to f/4.4 (@876mm). The combination is then designed for cameras up to APS-C format. We recommend the secondary mirror with 70mm (minor axis).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Assembly and collimation instructions:</em><br>The telescope is delivered disassembled into several units for safety. The assembly and adjustment are not complicated, you can download the instructions in advance.

<p>The 6"" f/6 UNC Newtonian is a compact and transportable all-round telescope. It is ideally suitable for visual observation and astrophotography. Astrophotographers will appreciate fine stars because of the small secondary mirror and in combination with suitable coma-correctors, deep-sky photography are possible in a relatively short time.</p>
<p><em>The advantages of the TS UNC Newtonian telescopes:</em><br></p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality, German-made high quality carbon tube.<br>
</li>
<li>Easy collimation of primary and secondary mirror - by hand, without tools.<br>
</li>
<li>The edge of the secondary mirror is blackened.<br>
</li>
<li>TS UNCN2-G2 2"" rack and pinion focuser with M54x0.75 intermediate thread.<br>
</li>
<li>The secondary is Pre-attached to the secondary mount with the correct offset.<br>
</li>
<li>94% reflectivity on primary mirror and secondary mirror for a brighter image<br>
</li>
<li>Diffraction limited primary mirror - each telescope is tested on an optical bench before shipment</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The carbon tube - finest precision work:</em><br>The carbon tube is extra solid and completely reinforced, not only around the focuser. This makes the tubes much stiffer and the adjustment stability is high. The openings for the secondary are precisely fitted with turned mating parts, ensuring that the secondary spider vanes are correct and the telescope produces perfect spikes right from the start.</p>
<p><em>Focus position optimized for astrophotography:</em><br>The focus point is 135mm above the tube. This allows you to use different focusers and still have a comfortable working distance. With the standard focuser UNCN2-G2 you even get 80mm working distance, this even allows the use of focal reducers or a binoviewer with moderate glass path compensation. For standard correctors we recommend a 20mm spacer, which sits between the focuser. This gives you 60mm backfocus.</p>
<p>Note: For visual observation you need a 2"" extension tube - <a href=""https://www.horizonastronomy.ie/collections/astrophotography-accessories/products/ts-optics-2-extension-tube-35mm"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Click here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The 2"" TS UNCN2-G2 RAP focuser:</em><br>A core component of the TS UNC-Newtons is the modern TS UNCN2-G2 focuser. The focuser builds up only 58mm from the tube edge and still carries heavy cameras and accessories without tilting. The focuser is superior to conventional Crayford focusers.<br>
</li>
<li>High stiffness with extremely short length.<br>
</li>
<li>Exact 1:10 dual-speed gear - for perfectly focused astrophotographs.<br>Adjustment is decoupled from the ball bearing - a clear advantage over Crayford focusers<br>
</li>
<li>Threaded connection of accessories is possible - the 2"" receptacle can be unscrewed, then an M54x0.75 female thread is available.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Parabolic primary mirror:</em><br>Newtonian primary mirrors made of fused silica are free of strain and provide an image that is usually much better than diffraction limited types. The surface is coated with an enhanced 94% reflection layer and a protective quartz layer. The primary mirror has a central marking as an adjustment aid.</p>
<p><em>Every TS Carbon Newtonian is tested on our optical bench before shipping:</em><br>These are a solid telescope for life. After assembly, Each UNC Newtonian is subjected to an optical test at the workshop before shipping. This ensures that the telescope will fit your accessories perfectly and will deliver the optical performance promised.</p>
<p>Before shipping, the primary mirror with the cell is removed from the tube and packed separately. This is to guarantee a safe shipment and avoid unnecessary transport damages.</p>
<p><em>Choose your focus positions and change of secondary mirror diameter:</em><br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(37, 163, 34);""><strong>Focus position No.1</strong></span> - with 60mm above the 2"" receptacle has proven to be very versatile. Nevertheless, we can also offer you individual focus positions and other secondary mirror sizes - Just contact us prior to purchase.<br>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(37, 163, 34);""><strong>Focus position No.2</strong></span> - 30mm above the 2"" connection - optimal for visual observation. The secondary mirror can be slightly smaller, we recommend a secondary mirror with 63mm (minor axis) which is sufficient even for 2"" eyepieces.<br>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(37, 163, 34);""><strong>Focus position No.3</strong></span> - 90mm above the 2"" connection - this allows you to use a 0.73x reducer/corrector and change the focal ratio from f/6 to f/4.4 (@657mm). The combination is then designed for cameras up to APS-C format. We recommend the secondary mirror with 70mm (minor axis).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Assembly and collimation instructions:</em><br>The telescope is delivered disassembled into several units for safety. The assembly and adjustment are not complicated, you can download the instructions in advance.

SK0000062-UK,Celestron CPC 800 HD - Deluxe,"<p><strong>The CPC 800 HD Deluxe is the portable fork-mounted top-class telescope from Celestron and features the StarBright XLT coating. The telescope is perfect for visual observations and, with an optional polar wedge and an astro camera, also enables professional astrophotography.</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Optical Design:</strong><br>EdgeHD (Edge High Definition) optics combine the compact design of a Schmidt-Cassegrain with significantly improved image quality at the edge of the image. This optical system not only offers astrograph characteristics, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view. This not only corrects off-axis coma—as with other so-called ""coma-free"" optical designs available on the market—but also field curvature! All EdgeHD telescopes deliver a large, flat field of view, enabling sharp star images even at the edge of large CCD sensors.</p>
<p><strong>Built-in GPS:</strong><br>The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature a built-in GPS sensor that automatically receives the date, time, and your exact location from the GPS satellites. This eliminates the need to manually enter this data.</p>
<p><strong>SkyAlign:</strong><br>This is Celestron's incredibly easy alignment process for perfect GoTo positioning. The telescope no longer requires a defined home position: Simply align three bright stars (planets and the moon are also possible) one after the other in the telescope's field of view, and voilà! Your CPC telescope is ready for automatic GoTo positioning to any object from the hand control's database.</p>
<p>SkyAlign calculates your telescope's alignment based on the trajectories of the three stars and the corresponding angles. SkyAlign retrieves the other required data (date, time, and location coordinates) via the integrated 16-channel GPS receiver.</p>
<p>"" SkyAlign "" only works in azimuthal mode, i.e., when the telescope is operated directly on the tripod without a polar wedge. Celestron also offers several new and simplified alignment methods for equatorial operation in the CPC series.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Database:</strong><br>The CPC telescope database contains over 40,000 celestial objects, including the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as galaxies and nebulae from the NGC catalog and planets. You can narrow down your search to simplify your search in this comprehensive database and hide objects that are currently below the horizon.</p>
<p>The ""Identify"" function tells you what you're currently seeing in the telescope, and it also lets you easily explore the sky. Simply point the telescope at any area of the sky and, for example, display the nearest Messier objects—the telescope will move to them for you. You can do this in different areas of the sky and with different objects!</p>
<p>With ""Solar Sys Align"" you can align the telescope using the sun or moon even during the day to observe the planets or the brightest stars in the daytime sky.</p>
<p>Hyperstar Compatible: All EdgeHD tubes allow you to remove and replace the secondary mirror. The result: With the optional HyperStar optics, your standard Celestron EdgeHD telescope becomes a digital Schmidt Design for your CCD or DSLR camera for primary focus photography.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative features of the Mount:</strong></p>
<p>Design - For the CPC Deluxe HD telescopes, Celestron has redesigned the drive mechanism. It features a 15 cm (6 inch) brass gear with 180 teeth and a stainless steel worm gear, as well as a unique steel and nylon ball bearing design for even smoother tracking for long-exposure deep-sky imaging.</p>
<p>Innovation - The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature the innovative All-Star™ Polar Alignment . When used with the optional polar wedge, you can align the telescope to any bright star in equatorial mode—no need to look at Polaris! Astrophotographers will also appreciate the Permanent Periodic Error Correction (PEC) feature. You can record the helical error so it's automatically corrected in the future.</p>
<p>Power Management - The redesigned electronics supply the motors with constantly regulated voltage, allowing them to move the telescope even when it's not fully balanced. This maintains smooth operation and high GoTo accuracy.</p>
<p>Performance - You can track objects far beyond the meridian, allowing you to observe the most interesting part of the sky without interruption.<br>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</p>

SK0000066-UK,"Celestron NexStar Evolution - 8"" EdgeHD (With StarSense)","<p><strong>The innovative NexStar Evolution is a compact, portable and mechanically solid telescope. This set adds the StarSense AutoAlign module to the Evo mount, taking the alignment process off your hands: the built-in camera orients itself to the sky and initiates the telescope for computer control and automatic tracking. The 8"" EdgeHD tube delivers a flat, bright image of the sky.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to do anything during setup, the telescope automatically orients itself with the sky within a few minutes! With the additional options, the NexStar Evolution 8"" HD set is an extremely powerful, user-friendly and quick-to-use combination.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Differences between the EdgeHD tube instead of the standard Schmidt-Cassegrain : </em><br>The EdgeHD telescopes not only offer photographers the advantage of a flattened field of view, but also have an improved focusing mechanism, ventilation openings with fine dust sieves for faster temperature equalization.</li>
<li>StarSense module – The telescope automatically orients itself to the starry sky, all you have to do is set it up and switch it on.<br>
</li>
<li>StarPointer Pro instead of StarPointer – With aiming circles and brighter, dimmable LED is also suitable for daytime observations.<br>
</li>
<li>Perfect WiFi control via tablet or smartphone.<br>
</li>
<li>The planetarium program on your smartphone shows you the current sky view or a list of observation targets for your location. The SkyPortal app for iOS and Android also supports automatic initialization of the computer control (""alignment"") via the StarSense module.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Simple and convenient operation:</em><br>The NexStar Evolution telescopes have been developed based on customer feedback from the past few years. They offer many well thought-out details so that you can enjoy the most beautiful night possible under the starry sky. </p>
<p>No more worrying about batteries or an external power supply. The NexStar Evolution is the first amateur telescope to have a built-in lithium iron phosphate battery. One charge lasts up to ten hours. You can even use the Evolution's USB port to power other devices you want to use at night.</p>
<p>The NexStar Evolution is easy to set up thanks to the large, ergonomic handles. The steel tripod has markings so you can easily extend all legs to the same length. The azimuth and elevation clamps allow you to point the telescope at a target even without power. Up to seven eyepieces can be stored in two storage compartments - one even has a dimmable red LED light.</p>
<p>More power and safety thanks to lithium iron phosphate battery:<br>Instead of a typical lithium polymer battery, a lithium iron phosphate battery is used in the Evolution telescopes. These LiFePO 4 batteries have several advantages over simple LiPo batteries:</p>
<p><strong>High safety &amp; Reliability:</strong><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike LiPo batteries, LiFePO 4 batteries cannot explode or ignite, but are considered intrinsically safe. The improved power density ensures a high load capacity even with continuous current consumption.<br>
</li>
<li>Long service life and cycle stability.<br>
</li>
<li>Wide temperature range for storage and operation<br>
</li>
<li>Low self-discharge<br>
</li>
<li>Excellent tracking accuracy, suitable for astrophotography</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in astrophotography, a NexStar Evolution is an excellent and affordable way to get started. It's the only fork-mounted telescope series in this price range with worm gears, along with improved motors. Planetary photography with a DSLR or a planetary camera is also no problem at all, and with a polar wedge you can also set it up equatorially to take long exposure deep sky images, be it with a DSLR or an Astro Camera.</p>
<p>The Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes with the StarBright XLT coating deliver bright, sharp images and are just as interesting for visual observers as they are for astrophotographers.</p>

SK0000074-UK,Celestron CGEM II - 925,"<p><strong>CGEM II 925 HD combines Celestron's newly redesigned CGEM II computerized equatorial mount with its acclaimed EdgeHD optical system. With over 9 inches of aperture and our premium StarBright XLT coatings, the CGEM II 925 HD gives you over 1000 times the light gathering power than the unaided eye. </strong></p>
<p>Designed to give diffraction limited performance and offer more resolution than the 800 with less weight than the 1100, the CGEM II 925 HD is a premier astroimaging telescope.</p>
<p><strong>Optical Tube Info:</strong></p>
<p><em>See the Universe in HD:</em><br>EdgeHD is an aplanatic, flat field Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope that produces aberration-free images across a wide visual and photographic field of view. The optical system was designed to reduce more than just off-axis star coma; it also provides an astrograph-quality flat focal plane all the way to the edge of the field of view.</p>
<p><em>True Astrograph Quality:</em><br>Many optical designs that advertise themselves as ""astrographs"" actually only produce pinpoint stars across a curved focal plane. While this may be acceptable for some visual observing, stars will appear out of focus at the edge when used with the flat chip sensor of a digital camera. EdgeHD optics produce a focal plane more than three-times flatter than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and dramatically flatter than competing coma-free designs. This guarantees you visibly sharp stars across some of the largest CCD chips available today. Learn more about EdgeHD technology.</p>
<p><em>Improved Performance:</em><br>Superior edge performance not only creates rounder, more pleasing stars, but actually improves the resolution and limiting magnitude when compared to telescopes of equal aperture. With Celestron’s StarBright XLT optical coatings on every surface, EdgeHD optics gives you maximum light throughput across the widest visual and photographic spectrum.</p>
<p><em>Mechanical Features:</em><br>In addition to EdgeHD’s optimized optical design, the telescope tube has been redesigned to make sure you get the most from your optics each and every night.</p>
<p>Mirror clutches - Flexible tension clutches hold the mirror in place and reduce image shift when taking long exposure astro-images. Once focused, the flexible rods allow the mirror to be held in place without putting any force or pressure on the mirror assembly, keeping the image centered in the eyepiece (or on the sensor).<br>Tube vents - Cooling vents located on the rear cell allow hot air to be released from behind the primary mirror. Each vent has an integrated 50-mesh filter guaranteed to let warm air out without letting dust in.<br>Fastar versatility - EdgeHD is the most versatile imaging telescope available today. At its native f/10, you can achieve the image scale necessary to capture the smallest of deep sky objects. A Barlow gives you added power for high-resolution planetary, lunar and solar imaging. All EdgeHD optical tubes are Fastar-compatible, allowing the secondary mirror to be removed and replaced with a third party lens accessory for ultra-fast f/2 wide field imaging.<br>Individually Tested<br>Every EdgeHD that ships has been tested not only for the surface quality of each optical component, but also with a camera and artificial star to ensure the imaging system meets our rigid quality assurance. This “final acceptance test” confirms the EdgeHD will perform in the field and deliver high-quality astroimages.</p>

SK0000075-UK,Celestron CGX - 9.25 EdgeHD,"<p><br><strong>The CGX mount only looks similar to the cheaper CGEM-II at first glance, but it has been completely redesigned and offers many more features.</strong></p>
<p>The 20kg mount has a real photographic payload of 25kg, so you can really work with 25kg payload and don't have to plan for generous reserves for photography, as is often the case. Thanks to the large carrying handles, it is even easier to transport than a comparable, slightly lighter classic parallactic mount! With the dual dovetail clamp for CG-5 (Vixen, Celestron) or CGE (3-inch), you can easily switch between small solar telescopes and large Schmidt-Cassegrains, for example.</p>
<p>The mount has been given more powerful, faster-reacting motors that are connected to the axes via a sturdy toothed belt. This means the mount responds almost immediately to control commands, even from an autoguider. There is no play in the gears, and since the worm gears are also spring-loaded, the play is largely eliminated - you don't have to readjust even when there are large temperature differences, as the worms and gears have optimal contact.</p>
<p>The new, large screws are easy to grip, so you can loosen or tighten them easily even when wearing gloves - the polar height adjustment has also been revised so that you can easily adjust the mount even when it is fully loaded. A polar finder will be available as an option, but is generally unnecessary: ​​With the All-Star Polaralign you can align the mount to any brighter star through the telescope, and for perfection, the polar finder has always been superior to the polar finder. As a special feature, you can move the mount on the base plate of the extra-wide tripod head - this allows you to position the center of gravity perfectly over the tripod, for the entire usable latitude range from 3 to 65° north or south latitude. The flat base can also be easily adapted to your own columns. Celestron provides a flange drawing ( PDF ) for fixed installation.</p>
<p>As a photo mount, it is just as suitable for mobile use as it is for remote operation. Internal sensors (“switches”) automatically bring the mount into the home position and prevent it from moving too far and hitting something when panning. The internal cabling also serves to ensure safety: all connections (power, hand controller, AUX and autoguider) are in the base of the mount and do not move with it.</p>
<p>The hand controller can be controlled in the traditional way via ASCOM and the hand controller (new: with USB connection) via PC, or you can use the control software included in the delivery, which was developed together with Planewave Instruments. Multipoint GoTo modeling, plate solving and control of the focuser are just a few functions that you normally have to add for remote operation - with the CGX this software is included in the delivery. Here you do not need the hand controller, but can use the USB connection on the mount directly.</p>
<p><em>The Telescope Optics:<br></em>The EdgeHD optics (Edge High Definition) combine the compact design of a Schmidt-Cassegrain with significantly improved imaging at the edge of the image. This optical system not only offers the properties of astrographs, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view. Not only is the coma outside the optical axis corrected - as with other so-called ""coma-free"" optical designs available on the market (see also our test image) - but also the field curvature!</p>
<p>Many optical systems are promoted as ""astrographs""; however, they produce the coveted ""pinpoint"" star image along a curved image plane. On images taken with modern CCD cameras, the result is a noticeable field curvature that increases towards the edge of the image field and becomes stronger the larger the chip is; i.e. the stars remain round, but are blown up into small rings (""donuts"") towards the edge.</p>
<p>With the Celestron Edge HD telescopes, this field curvature is corrected right up to the edge in addition to the coma, so that even images taken with large CCD chips are completely sharp, with a uniformly large star image across the entire chip - right into the corners of the image field.</p>
<p>This also significantly improves the resolution and limiting magnitude compared to competing optical systems with a similar aperture. The Celestron XLT multi-coating also helps the Edge HD optics to achieve a significant increase in performance compared to similar systems on the market.</p>
<p><em>In addition to the new optics, the mechanics and tube have also been completely redesigned. The new features include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mirror locks hold the main mirror in any focus position without exerting pressure on the optical elements. The image always remains stable on the chip, even with long exposure times.<br>
</li>
<li>Ventilation openings behind the main mirror ensure rapid air exchange, so that the optics cool down at an unrivalled speed. Thanks to an air filter system, no dust gets into the tube.<br>
</li>
<li>HyperStar Compatible – All EdgeHD tubes allow you to remove the secondary mirror and replace it with the optional HyperStar optics. The result: your standard Celestron EdgeHD telescope becomes a digital Schmidt Design for your CCD or DSLR camera for primary focus photography at f/2 (C8, C11) and f/1.9 (C14).<br>To learn more about this system, visit the dedicated EdgeHD website .<br>
</li>
<li>Adapted telecompressors (f/7.5) and Barlow lenses (f/20) are under development.<br>
</li>
<li>Axiom eyepieces - The Edge HD 9.25 comes with an Axiom eyepiece from Celestron. With a 23mm focal length and 82° field of view, you get an impressive combination of magnification and field of view.</li>

SK0000077-UK,Vixen AXD2 with VMC 260 Maksutov-Cassegrain,"<p><strong>The optics of the VMC260L surpass that of the traditional Schmidt-Cassegrain and are only 650mm long despite its high focal length of 3000mm. With its large aperture of 260mm (10""), this optical telescope collects a huge amount of light for serious professional observations and photography of the planets, as well as countless deep-sky objects.</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The dielectrically coated mirrors of the VMV260L guarantee extremely high sharpness and maximum brightness. Thanks to the open tube, these devices also cool down faster than conventional closed Cassegrain systems. For further expansion, an optional 0.62x focal reducer is available to reduce the aperture ratio to 1:7.1. This results in a shortening of the exposure times and easier photography of larger objects. Included with this telescope is a dovetail rail and a carrying handle, which can also be used as a camera mount for star field shots.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>The AXD2 mount in detail:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">This hight quality professional grade mount is made from using robust construction and a lightweight housing with a max load capacity of 30 kg (Photographic). The A7075 Super alloy, which is the strongest of aluminum alloys, is used for the R.A. and DEC axes. The stability of the A7075 superalloy is stronger than titanium, which is known as a lightweight material with extremely high strength. Its density is 38% less than titanium. The use of the A7075 super alloy for the axles makes the AXD mount lightweight yet stable and the rotating parts of the AXD mount have a total of 21 bearings. This ensures a very even movement to pan and track objects.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Stepper Motors:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Vixen chose more accurate stepper motors for the mount to excercise its full performance potential. The disadvantage of large stepper motors with equally large steps has been eliminated by the Micro-Step Motion Control System which generates 400 pulses per second at high speed. This creates a very quiet sampling without vibrations and the stepper motors of the AXD mount have more than sufficient torque for high loading equipment. This is most evident when working at high magnification and photographing using CCD photography with small pixel sizes.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Worm gears:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The sizes of the worm gears have been increased in the latest Atlux version. The AXD mount has 270 teeth in R.A. and 216 teeth in DC. Both axes are 50mm in diameter. As a result, the mount achieves a very high degree of accuracy and running stability.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Low play:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Thanks to the Vixen Micro-Step Motion Control System, the stepper motors run extremely smoothly from low to high speed. This eliminates the use of reduction gears in the drive and therefore reduces the play in the transmission.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Elegant design:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The flat sides of the mount have been taken from previous generations of the New Atlux range. The white and silver-coloured housing ensures a modern and elegant exterior with high functionality - The AXD is the flagship of the Vixen mount series.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The AXD mount is equipped with a 6x20 polar finder telescope as standard. With the scale built into the polar finder, you can achieve a simple and accurate pole alignment in the northern hemisphere and for observation in southern latitudes, the constellation Octans is viewed in the polar viewfinder, which is then set congruently with the real stars.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Periodic Errors Correction VPEC:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Usually, periodic errors are measured on mounts and corrected by the user. Since the old StarBook did not save this error permanently, the Starbook Ten has addressed this problem and now the periodic error of the mount is measured in the factory and eliminated before delivery. This is called VPEC and works automatically as soon as you use the mount. They achieve an accuracy of +/- 2.8 arc seconds. You will even be able to further increase tracking accuracy by saving your own recorded periodic error.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>Telescope &amp; Mount Spec:</strong></p>

SK0000078-UK,"Vixen AXD2 Goto mount with AX103S APO Triplet - 4""","<strong>The AX103S Refractor is a professional grade ED Triplet Apochromat and has been developed for astrophotography for all cameras up to and including full-frame cameras and this one has a Triplet ED lens and at the rear area there is an image field flattening lens.</strong><br><br>This f8 refractor can also use an optional focal reducer which can further reduce the focal ratio to achieve even faster results in astrophotography. The 60 mm ring on the focuser allows you to attach 2"" eyepieces and a camera adapter. While the AX103S has been specially developed for professional astrophotography purposes, its also a real visual highlight, especially when observing the moon and planets using an eyepiece. This is a telescope that will delight you for a lifetime.<br><br><strong>The AXD2 mount in detail:</strong><br><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Observatory class AXD2 mount comes with the new 'Starbook Ten' controller and the PFL polar finder, which makes it quick and easy to align the mount via reference stars. </span>Robust construction and a lightweight housing with a photographic load capacity of 30 kg. The A7075 Super alloy, which is the strongest aluminum alloy available, is used for the R.A. and DEC axes. <br><br>The stability of the A7075 superalloy is stronger than titanium, which is known as a lightweight material for high strength. Its density is 38% less than titanium. The use of the A7075 super alloy for the axles makes the AXD mount lightweight yet stable. The rotating parts of the AXD mount have a total of 21 bearings ensuring the smoothest of movement.<br><br><em>Stepper motors:</em><br>Vixen chose more accurate stepper motors for this mount in order to exploit the full performance potential. The disadvantage of stepper motors with large steps has been eliminated by the Micro-Step Motion Control System. The system generates 400 pulses per second at high speed. This creates a very quiet sampling without vibrations while the stepper motors of the AXD mount have more than sufficient torque for higher loads. This is most evident when working at high magnification and astrophotography using CCD astrophotography cameras with small pixel sizes.<br><br><em>Worm gears:</em><br>The sizes of the worm gears have been increased in the latest Atlux version. The AXD mount has 270 teeth in R.A. and 216 teeth in DC. Both axes are 50 mm in diameter. As a result, the mount achieves a high degree of accuracy and running stability.<br><br><em>Low backlash:</em><br>Thanks to the Vixen Micro-Step Motion Control System, the stepper motors run extremely smoothly from low to high speed. This eliminates the use of reduction gears in the drive system and therefore reduces the play in the gears.<br><br><em>Elegant design:</em><br>The flat sides of the mount have been taken from previous generations of the New Atlux range. The white and silver-coloured housing ensures a modern and elegant exterior with high functionality. This AXD mount is the flagship of the Vixen mount series.<br><br><em>Polar finder telescope:</em><br>The AXD mount is equipped with a 6 x 20 polar finder telescope as standard. With the scale built into the polar finder, you can achieve a simple and accurate poler alignment in the northern hemisphere.<br>For observation in southern latitudes, the constellation Octans is imaged in the polar viewfinder, which is then set congruently with the real stars.<br><br><em>Periodic Errors Correction VPEC:</em><br>Usually, periodic errors are measured on mounts and corrected by the user. Since the old StarBook did not save this error permanently, the Starbook Ten has addressed this problem. The periodic error of the mount is now measured in the factory and eliminated before delivery. This is called VPEC and it works automatically as soon as you use the mount.<br>They achieve an accuracy of +/- 2.8 arc seconds. You will be able to further increase tracking accuracy by saving your own recorded periodic errors.<br><br><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong><br>

SK0000087-UK,Explore Scientific BT-120 SF Giant Binoculars,"<p><strong>Observe the beauty of the starry night sky in almost 3D with these specialised Explore Scientific Giant Astro Binoculars. Globular star clusters, glowing gas </strong><strong>nebulae, the moon with its many craters and even planets can be observed in outstanding detail on a clear night. Also suitable for viewing nature and landscape during the day.</strong></p>
<p>These large, light-gathering lenses and professional grade coatings on all lens surfaces, ensure these binoculars produce bright and brilliant views all the time. The comfortable 45 degree viewing angle allows fatigue-free use, even when the binoculars are tilted upwards towards the zenith. Large binoculars of this type can also be called a double refractor telescope because in this configuration, the full light gathering power of one single telescope is available to each eye. Experience a whole new dimension of observing as a consequence making the moon and stars appear like you can reach out and literally touch them - one of the main advantages that binoculars have over small basic telescopes.<br><br>These extremely robust binoculars have a magnesium housing, sealed and filled with nitrogen gas to prevent fogging and moisture on the inside of the optics. The BT series binoculars are designed for tough outdoor use. The very light magnesium housing saves weight and makes them easier to handle (however they do need to be mounted on a tripod due to their physical size). Two Explore Scientific 20mm eyepieces from the 62° LER series range are also included. However you can change the eyepieces to achieve higher magnification and almost any plug in type 1.25"" eyepieces are suitable.<br><br>You can even use standard 1.25"" colour or nebula filters which thread into the eyepiece for astronomical observations to further enhance your views of deep sky objects. However do keep in mind the use of eyepieces and colour / nebula filters must of course always be done in pairs.<br><br>The 45-degree viewing angle allows nice relaxed observation positions even when the binoculars are tilted towards the zenith. Also the individual interpupillary distance can be adjusted in a range from 54 to 76mm. With the fine helical individual focuser, precise focusing is achieved quite effortlessly. The integrated dew caps can also be removed in high humidity as well as cold conditions and even extended - This helps avoid fogging of the outer objective lenses and offers a barrier against stray light from the side.<br><br>A metal carrying handle located at the Bino's center of gravity which facilitates transport and ensures a secure grasp during tripod assembly. When using these large binoculars, a sturdy photo tripod with an appropriate load capacity is <br>required. The connection is made via two 1/4 inch or one 3/8 inch threaded holes (standard photo tripod thread) in the tripod adapter of the binoculars. <br><br><strong>Features:</strong> <br></p>

SK0000088-UK,Explore Scientific BT-70 SF Giant Binoculars,"<p><strong>Observe the beauty of the starry night sky in almost 3D with these specialised Explore Scientific Giant Astro Binoculars. globular star clusters, glowing gas </strong><strong>nebulae, the moon with its many craters and even planets can be observed in outstanding detail on a clear night. Also suitable for viewing nature and landscape during the day.</strong></p>
<p>These large, light-gathering lenses and professional grade coatings on all lens surfaces, ensure these binoculars produce bright and brilliant views all the time. The comfortable 45 degree viewing angle allows fatigue-free use, even when the binoculars are tilted upwards towards the zenith. Large binoculars of this type can also be called a double refractor telescope because in this configuration, the full light gathering power of one single telescope is available to each eye. Experience a whole new dimension of observing as a consequence making the moon and stars appear like you can reach out and literally touch them - one of the main advantages that binoculars have over small basic telescopes.<br><br>These extremely robust binoculars have a magnesium housing, sealed and filled with nitrogen gas to prevent fogging and moisture on the inside of the optics. The BT series binoculars are designed for tough outdoor use. The very light magnesium housing saves weight and makes them easier to handle (however they do need to be mounted on a tripod due to their physical size). Two Explore Scientific 20mm eyepieces from the 62° LER series range are also included. However you can change the eyepieces to achieve higher magnification and almost any plug in type 1.25"" eyepieces are suitable.<br><br>You can even use standard 1.25"" colour or nebula filters which thread into the eyepiece for astronomical observations to further enhance your views of deep sky objects. However do keep in mind the use of eyepieces and colour / nebula filters must of course always be done in pairs.<br><br>The 45-degree viewing angle allows nice relaxed observation positions even when the binoculars are tilted towards the zenith. Also the individual interpupillary distance can be adjusted in a range from 54 to 76mm. With the fine helical individual focuser, precise focusing is achieved quite effortlessly. The integrated dew caps can also be removed in high humidity as well as cold conditions and even extended - This helps avoid fogging of the outer objective lenses and offers a barrier against stray light from the side.<br><br>A metal carrying handle located at the Bino's center of gravity which facilitates transport and ensures a secure grasp during tripod assembly. When using these large binoculars, a sturdy photo tripod with an appropriate load capacity is <br>required. The connection is made via two 1/4 inch or one 3/8 inch threaded holes (standard photo tripod thread) in the tripod adapter of the binoculars. <br><br><strong>Features:</strong> <br></p>

SK0000089-UK,Explore Scientific Large Binoculars U-Mount,"<p><strong>This large fork mount with precision adjustable mechanics for large binoculars are designed for use with large professional binoculars such as our Explore Scientific </strong><strong>BT range. </strong></p>
<p>When using giant binoculars such as these, a stable mount and tripod with an appropriate load capacity is absolutely necessary. The experience of viewing the night sky using extremely high power with both eyes is quite a memorable experience, making you feel like you can reach out and literally touch the stars. <br><br>The new Explore Scientific U-mount with field tripod also fits most other binoculars from 70 to 120mm lens diameter, which have a 1/4 inch photo thread connection on the underside. With the U-mount there is no shaking or annoying vibrations, the combination is as solid as a rock and provides the unlimited observation pleasure in all binocular positions. Whether you are observing the starry sky or the landscape, the U-mount allows soft and smooth movements in both axis.<br><br>The Explore Scientific U-mount has an excellent mechanism with adjustable friction in both axis, which allows you to adjust the friction to your preference making movement and tracking much more comfortable even when fully loaded. The binoculars can be mounted and removed in a few seconds using the quick-release adapter plate included. This is a major advantage, especially for mobile outdoor use. The connection between binoculars and adapter plate is made by two 1/4 inch threaded bolts (standard photo tripod thread), which are variably guided in a slotted hole. The double screw connection guarantees a very secure fit for the binoculars. The adapter plate itself is also attached to the U-mount by two large clamping screws, which are easy to use even when wearing gloves.<br><br>The Explore Scientific tripod provides a firm safe stand for the mount. The solid aluminium and stainless steel construction effectively suppresses most vibrations and the large 50mm diameter stainless steel tripod legs and the aluminium tripod head plate offer maximum stability with a moderate transport weight of only 5.8kg. With retracted tripod legs, the transport dimensions are only 80cm long (Adjustable working range 100 to 140cm.) The included accessory tray additionally gives some tension outwards to the tripod legs and therefore increases the stability even further.<br><br><strong>Explore Scientific U-Mount Features:</strong><br></p>

SK0000092-UK,Bresser Sliding Mount for Binoculars,"<p><strong>The Bresser Slider binocular mount, with its revolutionary design, offers unprecedented comfort when observing the night sky with binoculars.</strong></p>
<p>The variable extension length of the two support rails (crossbars), the gimbal mounting head and various adjustable slip couplings mean that almost all binocular positions can be effortlessly adjusted. The binoculars then remain in the respective position thanks to the counterweights. During observation, it is usually not necessary to touch the binoculars themselves and regardless of whether you want to observe while standing, sitting on a swivel chair or lying on a sleeping mat or lounger, everything is possible. </p>
<p>The mount also represents an interesting alternative to normal tripod solutions for wheelchair users, where a tripod leg is usually always in the way. A steady view can be seen despite using larger binoculars. Normally at high magnification and medium-weight binoculars weighing 500 grams or more can be difficult, especially during longer observation periods because after just a short time,  your arms get tired and trying to maintain a steady view is almost impossible. A high photo tripod with a 360deg ball joint can certainly make a significant improvement but this solution is sometimes limited in terms of the freedom of movement of the binoculars and the position of the observer.  </p>
<p>The Bresser Slider binocular mount offers far more options here and means that almost all desired binocular positions can be reached effortlessly. The patented design with 2 counter-rotating support rails (traverses) is guided on special linear roller bearings inside the mount head with virtually no play. This allows the observer to vary the extension length as desired with little muscle power. The sliding resistance can be continuously adjusted using 2 adjustment screws. In the middle of the center of gravity of the slider mount there is an axis with an adjustable slip clutch for the tilt and rotation movement. All bearings work absolutely smoothly and without play. For quick leveling, there is even a 30mm fluorescent circular bubble level in the mount base, which is easy to read even in the dark. </p>
<p><em>The Gimbal mount head:</em><br>The gimbal mount head works in a similar way to a ball head. However, it offers a significantly higher load capacity and more stability. Here, too, the sliding resistance of all moving parts can be adjusted to suit the respective needs. The mount head has several mounting holes for mounting a binocular holder using a 1/4 inch photo screw or a standard GP prism clamp for mounting small telescopes. There are also various holes on the side walls of the mount head for additional accessories such as red light reading lamps, smartphone holders for using Sky apps such as 'Stellarium' or LED viewfinders for quickly targeting celestial objects.</p>
<p><em>Balancing weights:</em><br>Several balancing weights enable the binoculars or telescope to be precisely balanced. 2 counterweights each weighing 2.5 kg, 1.25 kg and 0.5 kg are included with the mount and can be attached to the mounting bolts on both sides at the rear end of the mount. The weights are secured to the bolts using the 2 spring tensioners included. Instead of counterweights, a filled sandbag can be attached to the existing mounting hook. This procedure reduces the transport weight for planned excursions.</p>
<p><em>Suitable for binoculars weighing up to 3.5 kg:</em><br>The Bresser slider mount can be used with binoculars weighing up to 3.5kg. But it is also very beneficial for much smaller binoculars too by obtain blur-free images during long-term observations. The mount is made using an optionally available binocular tripod adapter, which is attached to the mount head using a 1/4 inch photo thread screw.</p>
<p><em>Tripod connection:</em><br>The appropriate tripod adapter for using the optionally available Bresser stainless steel tripod ST-3 is already included in the scope of delivery of the slider mount. This converts the standardized large 3/8-inch photo tripod thread (internal thread) in the base of the slider mount into a metric M10 thread. This means that after dismantling the adapter, a stable standard photo or video tripod with 3/8-inch threaded bolts can also be used.</p>

SK0000099-UK,"TS LED Collimator for RC & Cassegrains (2"")","<p><strong>TS RCKOLLI 2"" LED collimator..</strong></p>
<p>This collimator is compatible with almost all common optical systems such as Schmidt-Cassegrain, RC, Dall-Kirkham and similar telescope types. Collimation can be easily done during the day and the collimator is very precise and the collimation result is largely independent of tilt.</p>
<p>To achieve high-quality collimation even in bright daylight, simply insert the collimator into your focuser and follow the appropriate operating instructions for your OTA if necessary. This collimator has two basic operating configurations: a refractor mode with active white LEDs and a Newtonian/reflector mode with active red LEDs. In addition, there is a third operating mode with LEDs off, which is intended for other OTAs.</p>
<p><strong>Collimation of Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes and similar systems.</strong><br>It is well known that collimating an RC is not an easy task. Thanks to this TS collimator, it is possible to achieve a very good collimation result even during the day. This means that you always have an optimally adjusted RC telescope at your disposal at night. Collimation is easy and can be carried out by anyone, however it is important that the secondary mirror of your telescope has a central marking.</p>

The Bresser Star Tracker Astronomical Photo Mount PM-100 is designed for a camera &amp; lens of max weight 2kg total to track in polar mode. In Azimut mode a weight up to 5.0kg is possible. <br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Large aperture, wide-angle lenses are ideal for astrophotography and a shot with a wide-angle lens can be exposed for up to several minutes and the stars will remain sharp, allowing you to capture some of the fainter details in night sky targets such as the Milkyway. However the Polar alignment must be extremely accurate for long exposure lengths but thanks to the integrated pole finder tunnel, this is done quickly and easily. After setting up the light and compact Star Tracker Photo Mount, simply set the approximate latitude (pole height) and aim Polaris through the integrated pole finder tunnel. Then mount the camera with the photo lens using the quick-release plate on the supplied ball head - With the ball head, the camera can pointed to any section of the sky.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The tracking is carried out by a precise stepper motor, which is controlled by an easy digital display screen.

It has been developed to track the stars and to compensate for the movement of the earth and is extremely simple and compact designed for use in every location on earth.</strong></p>
<p>If you have ever viewed a romantic, starry sky, you will surely have felt the desire to capture it on a camera but if you have tried to do this, you will know that it’s really not all that easy. This is because you need to have multiple exposures of several minutes if you want to photograph the stars. As our earth is always turning on its axis, the stars keep moving as time passes and as a result, in the photo become they long streaks of light on photographs. Today’s digital technology gives us the option of obtaining shorter exposure times by increasing the sensitivity of the sensor, but, unfortunately, this dramatically increases picture noise and the picture becomes very noisy and harsh. This makes it extremely difficult to take beautiful images of the night sky. For this reason, the Vixen company has developed the Polarie Star Tracker, which eliminates the problem of star migration. When you attach your camera to the Polarie, the device will track in the opposite direction of the earth’s rotation and this allows for sharp, point-like images of the starry sky even when using very long exposure times.</p>
<p>The multi-functional mode dial is adjustable for sky- and landscape-, moon-, sun- and star-tracking. Also included: USB connection for external power supply and a built-in compass for quick orientation. Available as optional extra accessories are a polar finder telescope for exact alignment with the celestial pole for long-exposure photography and a tripod.</p>

SK0000110-UK,Nano Tracker Astronomical Photo Mount,"<p><strong>The Nano Tracker is one of the smallest star tracking devices available for perfect long exposure Astro photos out in the wilderness - Suitable in Northern &amp; Southern Hemispheres. The Nano Tracker is recommended for all DSLR cameras and system cameras with a wide-angle or light telephoto lenses up to 2kg in weight.</strong></p>
<p><em>Nano Tracker - Incredibly detailed Milkyway Photography:</em><br>With Nano Tracker you can take very impressive long exposure photos of the beautiful night sky. All you need is a camera and a photo tripod. The Nano Tracker ensures accurate tracking and is not only intended for experienced astrophotographers who like to be able to shoot on the go but because it so simple to use, its also ideal for beginners in astrophotography.</p>
<p><em>The Nano Tracker compensates for the Earth´s rotation:</em><br>Because the Earth rotates on its own axis, all celestial objects seem to move from east to west i the sky. This means that any kind of long exposure of the night sky would result in the starts becoming long streaks of light instead of pinpoint stars. The Nano Tracker compensates for this movement meaning you can do much longer exposures and the stars appear pinpoint and much brighter in the photo. For an exact alignment in the northern hemisphere, simply align it with the Pole Star and the NanoTracker will be ready to go.</p>
<p><em>Tip: With a compass and your smartphone´s tilt sensor, you can also set up the NanoTracker perfectly in both the northern and southern hemispheres.</em></p>
<p><em>Time lapse and video animation made easy:</em><br>With the NanoTracker you can also create beautiful time-lapse series shots and movies, for example of landscapes with the changing shadows and clouds or stunning time lapse movies of the Milkyway. At night such videos impressively show the movement of the stars - especially when they are recorded at half sidereal speed.</p>
<p>This is what you need for successful operation:<br>The NanoTracker consists of the compact motor unit and the manual control box, which also contains the battery compartment. The motor unit is placed between the photo tripod with video pointer/ball head and a second ball head, which are not included. The manual control box contains the controls where you can set the desired speed. All you need other than the Nano Tracker is a good tripod with a ball or tilt head, and of course a camera. The best choice is a DSLR camera or system camera with a fast wide-angle lens and a programmable remote shutter release. As a photo tripod you can use any stable tripod.</p>
<p>You will also need three AA batteries, which are not included. At 20°C a set of batteries can last up to 5 hours, however as with all batteries, at low temperatures this time reduces. The battery compartment is integrated in the hand controller and is easily accessible so that you can change the batteries on frosty nights without having to adjust the tripod.</p>

SK0000114-UK,Bresser Messier Nebula EXOS-2 German Equatorial Mount,"<p><b>The Bresser EXOS-2 GoTo German Equatorial Mount is a full GOTO mount with tracking motors in both axes that follow celestial objects very precisely and can be accurately controlled using the 'Star Tracker' hand controller.</b></p>
<p><strong>The Mount and Tripod:</strong></p>
<p>The Bresser Nebula EXOS-2 is a stable mount with a high load capacity and precise tracking for both visual observations and astrophotography. Double radial groove ball bearings in both axes ensure precise, smooth motion, and the RA axis bearing has been optimized to reduce backlash. Additionally, the tripod is reinforced to suppress vibrations further. The Bresser EXOS-2 can be loaded with up to 13kg of optics for purely visual use or approx. 10kg for Astrophotography.</p>
<p><strong>Nebula - the powerful and flexible Goto system:</strong><br>With the Nebula Goto system you have the option several control methods. You can either operate the mount directly using its own digital Nebula control interface using your smartphone or tablet (iOS and Android supported). Alternatively, you can also use a planetarium software such as Sky Safari.Manual control remains an option as well using the included hand controller for minor corrections or simple control commands.</p>
<p>In addition to this, with the Bresser Nebula Goto Kit, you can connect your laptop or PC directly via WIFI or LAN cable (recommended for faster data transfer) to the Nebula control unit. This not only gives you full control over the mount but also allows you to connect various devices such as cameras, motor focus, filter wheels, etc. directly to the control unit via various USB ports. This eliminates the need to connect each device to your computer via cables. The pre-installed program KStars / EKOS lets you comfortably control all devices from your PC or laptop.</p>
<p>Electronic polar alignment or guiding can also be easily achieved with this Goto Kit, provided you have a camera connected. You are also not just limited to the software of the Nebula control unit. Thanks to the installed ASCOM Alpaca driver, you can use your own programs on your computer to control the mount - whether it's Stellarium or N.I.N.A. The two stepper motors with a belt drive ensure a smooth, direct drive of the two axes. It's only important to make sure you have a good balance on your mount setup.</p>

SK0000115-UK,Vixen Sphinx SXD2 WL German Equatorial Mount & Tripod,"<p><strong>Vixen has developed a new generation of Wireless Controlled SX mounts for demanding observers and Astrophotographers.</strong></p>
<p>The SXD2WL mount is easily operated via a WiFi module through a smartphone or tablet. The free STAR BOOK Wireless app is available for user-friendly control of the mount and this allows you to easily use practical celestial navigation functions such as automatic GoTo slewing to specific celestial objects via your smartphone or tablet. The mount's power consumption has also been reduced by up to 20% which enables astronomical observations and astrophotography over longer periods, especially in the field when using a Portable power supply.</p>
<p>Once you tap the desired celestial object from a list on the APP, the mount is automatically slewed to bring the object into the telescope's field of view and tracking begins. An existing STAR BOOK TEN control system can also be used on this mount without any problems. Equipped with the same precision stepper motors as the top-of-the-line AXD mount, the SXD2WL brings a new standard of performance and precision to the Vixen mount family and this mount is capable of a Photographic payload of 15kg.</p>
<p>The mount's axis system weighs just 9.2kg , making it ideal for mobile observing . The motors located in the lower part of the mount also act as counterweights, meaning the mount requires less weight for balancing and only larger or longer Telescopes require the use of the counterweight. The massive motor units are installed in the lower part of the declination axis, so the center of gravity of the SXD2 is below the intersection of the RA and DEC axes.</p>
<p>The heart of the SXD2 are the precision stepper motors, which offer better performance and response than previous models. The Micro-Step Motion Control system scores points with its powerful yet very smooth drive characteristics, which are present in both fine movements and fast panning. The bearings on the RA and DEC axes and the worm gears have been significantly improved to reduce the load on the motors. This allows the motors to run much more smoothly than in previous models. High-precision processing technologies also eliminate worm gear errors. The edges of both the worms and worm gears are particularly smooth, enabling extremely precise tracking.</p>
<p><em>Latitude Adjustment:</em><br>The latitude is adjustable between 0 and 70 degrees (divided into 3 zones, each adjustable by +/- 15 degrees, for high, medium, and low latitudes); the latitude scale is scaled in 2-degree increments; fine adjustment is achieved with a tangent screw head, approximately 0.8 degrees per turn.</p>
<p><em>Built-in PFL-II Polar Finder with Illumination:</em><br>The built-in 5x20 mm polar finder with a 10° field of view features a 3-star alignment system, eliminating the hassle of setting the date and time. The illuminated reticle with variable brightness and automatic shutoff is adjustable in 8 levels and illuminated in red. The adjustment accuracy is 3 arc minutes.</p>
<p><em>The wireless module in detail:</em><br>The Vixen WiFi adapter for EQ mounts  allows you to control your Vixen mount via a smartphone or tablet. This allows you to navigate the sky without any cables using the STAR BOOK Wireless smartphone app (free). The app instantly transforms your mobile device into a controller for the equatorial mount. The response time of the mount, which is considered the biggest disadvantage of wireless connections, has been reduced to a level comparable to that of wired solutions.</p>
<p><em>Operation similar to the STAR BOOK TEN controller:</em><br>The STAR BOOK Wireless app is structured in a similar way to that already known from the STAR BOOK TEN controller. Depending on the star map setting, it contains up to 259,000 celestial objects . Tap a celestial object in the object list and start the GoTo. The mount will then automatically move to this target and bring it into the telescope's field of view. You retain all the popular features of the traditional STAR BOOK TEN.</p>
<p><em>Convenient operation:</em><br>While looking through the telescope, you operate the mount by swiping on the app's star map. Since there are no buttons, you can simply glide your finger over the star map and operate the mount conveniently.</p>
<p><em>Extensive astronomical data included:</em><br>This includes data on easily observable celestial bodies such as Messier objects, NGC objects, and IC objects, as well as the sun, moon, planets, comets, and dwarf planets.</p>
<p><em>High-precision alignment:</em><br>Alignment to one or two stars allows you to position the mount quite precisely. Alignment to three or more stars allows for high-precision alignment of the mount for high magnifications. The objects are then moved precisely and centrally in the field of view of your telescope. The alignment information is saved and can be retained even when the device is turned off. By leaving the telescope in its current state without moving it after completing an observation, you can start with the same settings the next time you observe.</p>
<p><em>Custom setting options:</em><br>As with the STAR BOOK TEN control system, the app offers various custom settings such as gear backlash compensation, night mode in red, autoguider, as well as variable GoTo speed and LED brightness. You can also adjust the time of the lens tube reversal (meridian flip) as desired. Even if the object moves south during tracking, you can prevent the telescope tube from reversing.</p>
<p><strong>** Important Note:</strong><br><strong>The wireless module is not suitable for use on older SX mounts with the old blue Star Book controller.</strong></p>
<p><em>Technical information for the Wi-Fi module:</em><br></p>

SK0000117-UK,Explore Scientific iEXOS-100 GOTO PMC 8 German Equatorial Tracker Mount,"<p><strong>The iEXOS-100 is a complete computerized Wifi or Wired GOTO Equatorial Tracker mount with integrated PMC-Eight electronics suitable for attaching a small telescopes or DSLR Camera to a standard Vixen Style Dovetail Plate. The mount also has an ST4 compatible autoguider port for autoguiding if needed.</strong></p>
<p>This lightweight mount is an excellent choice as a grab and go mount with full GOTO capability. Its ideal for very light optics such as small 60mm - 80mm Refractors or as a Star tracker for larger DSLR cameras with larger lenses. It has no hand controller and is completely controlled using a tablet, laptop or desktop computer - either via Wifi or directly wired.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The PMC-Eight with its versatile connections is supported by free downloadable apps for Windows, Android, and iOS ready to connect to your favorite ASCOM Compliant Astronomical Software, allowing you to control the telescope from a few feet away or via an Internet connection from virtually anywhere in the world. <br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">One of the standout features of the iEXOS-100 system is its German equatorial design. When it comes to tracking the stars with a telescope, there is nothing that compares to a German equatorial mount because it will follow objects as they rise in the east and set in the west. Before you can track an object, you need to find it, and that objective can be daunting when you’re faced with a vast expanse of inky black sky. The iEXOS-100 puts a powerful GOTO system at your finger tips that takes the frustration out of navigating the night sky. This integrated version of Explore Scientific’s PMC-Eight™ system transcends the industry standard single processor by utilizing eight CPUs that operate independently of one another to focus on defined functions. This delegation of tasks among the processors results in a system that offers superior responsiveness, efficiency, reliability and astoundingly fast timing intervals for seamless images and accurate tracking. <br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Although it is internally complex, the GOTO system can be easily operated from your own Apple, Android or Windows tablet using the ExploreStars app, which has an intuitive nature that makes it simple and quick to align your telescope, navigate the stars and learn specifics about tens of thousands of celestial objects. The iEXOS-100 has locking clutches that will let you quickly reposition your telescope from one side to the other and an altitude knob for smooth height adjustments. The mount base includes a small polar alignment tunnel that allows users to roughly align their observing setup with Polaris. It also has a simple bubble level that comes in handy when stabilizing your tripod. Other features include a bracket for holding the battery pack, which powers the PMC-Eight system™ through 8 C batteries (not included); two 1 kg counterweights for balancing; and glow-in-the-dark markers on certain points of the mount and tripod so you can stay oriented with your setup at night.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Important Note:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">To start using the ExploreStars app, download the free app and download the celestial data set that contains the astronomical catalogs, reference images, and reference text. Simply by unzipping the ExploreStars folder containing the expanded celestial data set into your Pictures directory, you will expand the native database from a thousand objects to over seventy thousand objects. <br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>Mount Specs:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""></p>

SK0000118-UK,Celestron Equatorial Mount - AVX,"<p><strong>The Advanced VX Mounts set the standard for medium-sized telescopes. The mount was developed with the requirements of astrophotography  in mind. The Advanced VX offers many of the features of the large Celestron equatorial mounts, and at a very attractive price point.</strong></p>
<p>The Advanced VX is designed as an ideal platform for astrophotography with smaller telescopes (telescopes up to approx. 13kg - depending on the lever). Thanks to PEC (Periodic Error Correction), the periodic worm error that occurs in all mounts with classic worm gears can be compensated for, so that longer-exposure shots are also possible. You can also track objects far beyond the meridian without having to immediately carry out a Meridian Flip. This means you can observe the most interesting part of the sky without any interruption. The Advanced VX also has a much wider base than its predecessor, which further increases stability even with large loads. The improved motors have a higher torque and can better compensate for slight imbalances.</p>
<p>Since spring 2019, it has also included the dual dovetail clamp, so that both telescopes with the small CG5 rail (EQ standard) and the large CGE rail (3"" standard) fit on the AVX - without additional adapters! All you have to do is move the clamping screws. Larger telescopes in particular benefit from the wider rail, which offers more stability.</p>
<p><em>Third-party dovetail plates:</em><br>The Advanced VX is still compatible with Vixen format dovetail rails. However, the rail must be at least 100mm long as the clamping points on the new AVX are 90mm apart. If a user wants to use the AVX with a telescope that has a Vixen (or CG-5) dovetail rail that is shorter than 100mm, the rail must be replaced with a longer dovetail rail however suitable rails are also available from us.</p>
<p>The new AVX mount is not compatible with Losmandy D format dovetail rails. The CGE and Losmandy D formats are similar but not identical. Losmandy rails are about a millimeter wider, while CGE plates are deeper and have more surface contact with the dovetail clamp. To use an AVX with a telescope with a Losmandy D dovetail rail, the existing rail must be replaced with a compatible dovetail rail. Suitable rails are available from us.</p>
<p><em>Solid cast parts and heavy-duty mechanics:</em><br>Based on the proven Advanced GT mount, the Advanced VX not only offers large, easy-to-grip adjustment screws as well as more powerful motors that can cope better with unevenly distributed loads, but it also has a wider base for the tripod connection and an improved dual dovetail mount with two clamping screws. No premature tilting! Tracking is also possible up to 20° beyond the meridian passage.</p>
<p><em>State-of-the-art software:</em><br>The AVX mount is supplied with the cold-resistant, much more powerful NexStar+ hand controller. This means you have a modern computer control system at your disposal - with over 40,000 objects and multi-lingual navigation menu. Thanks to the built-in clock, setting up is even faster than before. The software automatically moves to the reference stars, you only have to center them in the eyepiece. Even the sun can serve as a reference object.</p>
<p>Advanced VX mounts can be also controlled via Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software via the PC connection on the hand controller</p>
<p><em>Orientation made easy:</em><br>With the AVX, you no longer have to laboriously adjust to the North Star using the polar finder scope: Align the mount roughly to the north, perform a 2-star alignment - and then call up the All-Star Polar Alignment. The software will then help you to align the mount precisely to the north, even if you cannot see the North Star. You can look comfortably through the telescope and do not have to kneel under the polar finder scope (which is still available as an option).</p>
<p><em>Versatile expandable:</em><br>In addition to a USB port on the hand controller, the AVX also has an autoguider input and two AUX ports. Here you can connect additional, separately available expansion modules - for example the SkyPortal WiFi module for control via WLAN with iPhone/iPad/Windows PC or the StarSense module , with which the mount automatically moves to its reference stars and centers them perfectly.</p>
<p>Experienced photographers will appreciate how easily this mount can be transported to a dark observing site. If you are new to astronomy or astrophotography, the Advanced VX will make it easy to get started and will serve you well for many years to come.</p>

SK0000120-UK,Celestron Equatorial Mount - CGX,"<p><strong>The CGX mount looks similar to the CGEM-II at first glance, but it has been completely redesigned and offers many more advances in both reliability and performance. This 20kg mount actually has a real photographic payload of 25kg. </strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the large carrying handles, it is even easier to transport than a comparable, slightly lighter classic parallactic mount and it also comes with the dual dovetail clamp for CG-5 (Vixen, Celestron) or CGE (3-inch), you can easily switch between small solar telescopes and large Schmidt-Cassegrains, for example. To make this suitable for photography too, the mount has been given more powerful, responsive motors that are connected to the axes via a sturdy toothed belt. This means that the mount responds almost immediately to control commands, even from an autoguider. There is no play in the gears, and since the worm gears are also spring-loaded, the play is largely eliminated - you do not have to readjust even in the event of large temperature differences, as the worms and gears have optimal contact.</p>
<p>The new, large screws are easy to grip, so you can loosen or tighten them easily even when wearing gloves - the polar height adjustment has also been revised so that you can easily adjust the mount even when it is fully loaded. A polar finder is available available as an option, but is generally unnecessary: ​​With the All-Star Polaralign you can align the mount to any brighter star through the telescope, and for perfection, the Polaralign option has always been superior to the standard polar finder. As a special feature, you can move the mount on the base plate of the extra-wide tripod head - this allows you to position the center of gravity perfectly over the tripod, for the entire usable latitude range from 3 to 65° north or south latitude.</p>
<p>As a photographic mount, it is just as suitable for mobile use as it is for remote operation. Internal sensors (""switches"") automatically bring the mount into the home position and prevent it from moving too far and hitting something when panning. The internal cabling also serves to ensure safety: all connections (power, hand controller, AUX and autoguider) are in the base of the mount and do not move with it.</p>
<p>The hand controller can be controlled in the traditional way via ASCOM and the hand controller (with USB connection) via PC, or you can use the control software included as a download, which was developed together with Planewave Instruments. Multipoint GoTo modeling, plate solving and control of the focuser are just a few functions that you normally have to add for remote operation - with the CGX this software is included.</p>

SK0000121-UK,Celestron Equatorial Mount - CGX L,"<p><strong>The CGX-L mount is the big brother of the CGX and has a very large payload capacity of up to 34kg - enough for even the largest Observatory grade Telescopes and accessories. With a weight of less than 24kg for the mount and 21kg for the tripod, it is still possible to transport thanks to the large carry handles and modular design.</strong></p>
<p>The CGX-L was developed for small observatories and remote operations, with a focus on a good payload-to-weight ratio, a compact design and innovative details for the use of large telescopes, photo equipment and the latest wireless accessories.</p>
<p>A key role is played by the generously dimensioned 144mm worm gears, which enable smoother running even with heavy telescopes, and the dovetail clamp, which has been extended to 270mm also holds large telescopes securely. For remote operation, there are optical sensors for the home and limit positions, simplified settings for north alignment and improved cable routing. There are also mechanical and ergonomic improvements that make the mount even more stable, user-friendly and transportable.</p>
<p>With the dual dovetail clamp for CG-5 (Vixen, Celestron) or CGE (3-inch), you can easily switch between smaller telescopes and large Schmidt-Cassegrains, for example. For Astrophotography, the mount has powerful responsive motors that are connected to the axes via a sturdy toothed belt. This means the mount responds almost immediately to control commands, even from an autoguider. There is no play in the gears, and since the worm gears are also spring-loaded, the play is largely eliminated - you don't have to readjust even when there are large temperature differences, the worms and gears have optimal contact.</p>
<p>The large screws are easy to grip, so you can loosen or tighten them easily even when wearing gloves - the polar height adjustment has also been redesigned so that you can easily adjust the mount even when it is fully loaded. A polar finder is available as an option, but is generally unnecessary: ​​With the All-Star Polaralign you can align the mount to any brighter star through the telescope, and for perfection, the Polaralign function has always been superior to the standard polar finder. As a special feature, you can move the mount on the base plate of the extra-wide tripod head - this allows you to position the center of gravity perfectly over the tripod, for the entire usable latitude range from 3 to 65° north or south latitude.</p>
<p>As a photographic mount, it is just as suitable for mobile use as it is for remote operation. Internal sensors (""switches"") automatically bring the mount into the home position and prevent it from moving too far and hitting something when panning. The internal cabling also serves to ensure safety: all connections (power, hand controller, AUX and autoguider) are in the base of the mount and do not move with it.</p>
<p>The hand controller can be controlled in the traditional way via ASCOM and the hand controller (with USB connection) via PC, or you can use the control software included as a download in the scope of delivery, which was developed together with Planewave Instruments. Multipoint GoTo modeling, plate solving and control of the focuser are just a few functions that you normally have to add for remote operation - with the CGX this software is included in the scope of delivery. Here you do not need the hand controller, but can use the USB connection on the mount directly.</p>

The mount itself weighs less than 5kg but can carry telescopes up to 15kg without counterweight. With counterweight and the counterweight rod (optional) the mount can then carry telescopes up to 20kg in weight. Several years of development and various patents have gone into this exciting new mount and the results speak for themselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So many functions and easy operation:</strong><br>The AM5 can be operated equatorially or azimuthally. For astrophotography, the equatorial mode is normally used and the mount must be aligned as accurately as possible with the celestial pole. For visual observing or lunar and planetary photography, the altazimuth mode is more than sufficient. The status indicator always shows in which mode the mount is: Red represents equatorial mode and green represents altazimuth mode so its easy to identify at a glance.</p>
<p><strong>No more counterweights needed:</strong><br>Normally, German equatorial mounts need counterweights to balance the telescope weight and this is the only way to ensure proper operation. However the AM5 uses robotics technology and it does not require counterweights for telescopes up to 15kg. This makes the AM5 lighter, more compact and easier to operate. Only for heavier telescopes up to a maximum of 20kg, then we recommend using counterweights to keep mount and tripod in balance.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth tracking is guaranteed:</strong><br>ZWO checks and measures every AM5 mount before delivery and guarantees a periodic error (""PE"") of less than +/-20 arc seconds and in addition to this the periodic error occurs very slowly, so that the autoguider has enough time to correct it. Via ASIAIR or another software the PE can also be reduced electronically.</p>
<p><strong>Useable anywhere on Earth:</strong><br>As you would expect from a true travel mount, the AM5 can be used anywhere on Earth, from the equator to the poles and the compact design of the mount means it has room in any medium sized luggage case.</p>
<p><strong>Polar alignment of the mount for astrophotography:</strong><br>In equatorial mode, the mount needs to be aligned exactly with the celestial north or south pole but small errors are of course corrected by autoguiding. Aligning the mount can also be done quickly and easily with the ASIAIR or other suitable software.</p>
<p><strong>No more control cables thanks to WiFi:</strong><br>All functions of the mount can also be controlled via smartphone when coupled with the ASIAIR for example. With the ASIAIR, everything from the camera to autoguiding and to the mount itself can be controlled via the ASI app using a smartphone or tablet. The mount can also be separately operated with the hand controller without a smartphone if preferred.</p>
<p><strong>Supports cable management to prevent cable entanglement:</strong><br>The saddle plate now integrates DC output and Type-C port to effectively prevent cable entanglement. The unique design ensures that the internal cables will not be twisted and worn when the DEC rotates.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Important notes:</em></span></p>
<p><em>There is an ASIAIR finder shoe attached on to the side of the AM5 which is meant for attaching a polar finder scope. This finder shoe is not suitable for mounting an ASIAIR as both the cables and the antenna of the ASIAIR can be crushed during movement.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to attach this finder shoe to a different location on the mount which is more suitable, such as on the side of the Losmandy / Vixen dovetail saddle plate, then make sure not to over tighten the Hex screws fully into the side panel or you will damage the insert threads. Keep the length of the inner threads between 3-5 mm.</em></p>
<p><em>Newer mounts have M4x3.5mm screws screwed into the saddle plate, these go into the side panel when the finder shoe is attached to the saddle plate along with the M4 x 8mm screws (it will not hold with the shorter screws).</em></p>

SK0000126-UK,Vixen Sphinx SXD2 WL Delux German Equatorial Mount,"<p><strong>Vixen has developed a new generation of SX mounts for demanding observers and astrophotographers. </strong><br></p>
<p>The SXD2 WL mount is simply operated via a Wifi module with a smartphone or tablet. By controlling the mount with your smartphone using the free Star Book Ten Wireless app, you can easily use sky navigation functions such as automatic GoTo panning of celestial objects via your smartphone or tablet. By eliminating the power consumption of the conventional LCD (STAR BOOK TEN), the power consumption on the mount is reduced by up to 20%, thus enabling longer astronomical observation and astrophotography. </p>
<p>When the desired celestial object is selected from a list, it is automatically panned into the telescope's field of view and tracking begins.  An existing Star Book Ten controller can also be used on this mount without any problems. The mount is equipped with the same precision stepper motors as the top model - the AXD mount, and the SXD2 WL brings a whole new standard of performance and precision to the Vixen mount family. </p>
<p>With a photographic load capacity of 15kg, the axis cross of the mount weighs just 9.2kg making it ideal for mobile observations. In addition, the motors are mounted in the lower part of the mount and therefore also serve as a counterweight, so the mount requires fewer weights for balancing. </p>
<p><strong>The SXD2 mount in detail:</strong></p>
<p>Precision stepper motors and micro-step motion control system <br>At the heart of the SXD2 are the precision stepper motors, which offer better performance and response than previous models. The micro-step motion control system offers powerful and yet very smooth drive characteristics, which are given both in fine movements and in fast pans. Built-in bearings The bearings of the RA and DEC axes and the worm shafts have been significantly improved to reduce the load on the motors. As a result, the motors move much more smoothly than in previous models. </p>
<p>High-precision worm gears High-precision processing technologies eliminate worm gear errors. The edges of the two worms and worm wheels are particularly smooth, enabling very precise tracking. Declination axis as counterweight The solid motor units are installed in the lower part of the declination axis so that the center of gravity of the SXD2 is below the intersection point of the RA and DEC axes. This means you need fewer additional counterweights. </p>
<p>Latitude setting The latitude is adjustable between 0 and 70 degrees (divided into 3 zones and adjustable +/- 15 degrees per zone, for high, medium and low latitudes); latitude scale in 2-degree increments; fine adjustment with a tangent screw head, approx. 0.8 degrees per turn. </p>
<p><strong>Built-in PFL-II polar finder with illumination:</strong><br>The built-in 5x20mm polar finder with 10° field of view has a 3-star alignment system. This eliminates the inconvenience of setting the date and original time. The illuminated reticle with variable brightness and automatic switch-off is adjustable in 8 levels and illuminated in red. The adjustment accuracy is 3 arc minutes. </p>
<p><strong>The wireless module in detail:<br></strong>The Vixen Wifi adapter for EQ mounts allows you to control your Vixen mount via a smartphone or tablet. With the smartphone app Star Book Wireless (free of charge) you can navigate the sky without any cables. The app turns your smartphone or tablet into a control unit for the equatorial mount in no time at all. The response delay of the mount, which is considered the biggest disadvantage of wireless connections, has been reduced to a level comparable to wired connections. </p>
<p>Reduced power consumption compared to conventional controllers with LCD monitor <br>The power consumption of the mount is reduced by up to 20%, allowing longer observations than with conventional wired controllers such as the STAR BOOK TEN. </p>
<p><strong>Operation similar to the Star Book Ten controller: </strong><br>The Star Book Wireless app has a similar structure to the Star Book Ten controller. Depending on the star map setting, it contains up to 259,000 celestial objects. Tap on a celestial object in the object list and start the GoTo. The mount will now automatically move to this target and bring it into the telescope's field of view. All the popular features of the Star Book Ten are retained </p>
<p><strong>Convenient operation:</strong><br>When looking through the telescope operate the mount by swiping on the app's star chart. As there are no buttons, simply slide your finger over the star chart to operate the mount conveniently. </p>
<p><strong>Extensive astronomical data included:</strong><br>In addition to data on easily observable celestial bodies such as Messier objects, NGC objects and IC objects, this also includes the sun, moon, planets, comets and dwarf planets. </p>
<p><strong>High-precision alignment:</strong><br>By aligning the mount to one or two stars, you can already achieve fairly precise positioning. By aligning the mount to three or more stars, you can achieve high-precision alignment of the mount for high magnifications. The objects are then approached precisely and centrally in your telescope's field of view. The alignment information is saved and can be retained even when the device is switched off. By leaving the telescope in its current state after completing an observation without moving it, you can start the automatic installation with the same settings for the next observation.  </p>
<p><strong>Individual setting options: </strong><br>As with the Star Book Ten control unit, the app offers various individual settings, such as gear backlash compensation, night mode in red, autoguider and variable GoTo speed and LED brightness. You can also set the timing of the reversal of the objective tube (meridian flip) as desired. Even if the object moves to the south during tracking, you can prevent the telescope tube from reversing. </p>
<p><strong>Important note: Cannot be used on old SX mounts with the old blue Star Book! </strong></p>
<p>Technical information about the Wifi module: CPU with 32-bit CISC processor 120 MHz The unit is connected to the mount via a D-SUB 9PIN connector as with the STAR BOOK TEN. It has a 6-pin 6-wire modular plug for external autoguider operation. Supported operating systems are Android 6 or higher, iOS 9.0 or higher, WLAN standard: IEEE 802.11b/g/n. </p>

SK0000127-UK,Vixen AXJ German Equatorial Mount,"<p>Designed as a complement to the AXD2 equatorial mount, the AXJ mount offers outstanding durability and precision and is the perfect mount for Professional Astronomers and Astrophotographers looking for a high payload, extremely accurate mount drive.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""></p>
<p>Periodic errors on mounts are usually measured and corrected by the user. Unlike the old StarBook controller, the StarBook 10 controller saves these errors permanently. The periodic error of the mount is measured in the factory (total of 12 points per 30 degrees worm gear) and corrected before delivery. This is known as V-PEC and functions automatically as soon as you use the mount. It delivers an accuracy of +/- 4.0 arc seconds. You can increase the tracking accuracy further by saving your own recorded periodic errors.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Vixen uses a new belt-drive system in the AXJ mount and the gear drive was replaced with a toothed belt. This gives the mount a quicker reaction time and lower backlash and also helps to minimize noise. The 6x20 polar finder scope is pre-installed into the mount. This allows the user to configure the polar alignment (for both the northern and southern hemispheres). The polar finder scope has a variable illuminated reticle with an automatic power-off function. The brightness can be adjusted in 8 levels so that the user can configure the desired brightness.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The mount has 2 bearing sets (4 pieces) which are used for the shaft of the RA axis. Thanks to the newly developed EQ design, the AXJ mount has a higher load capacity of 22 kg. As the motors, worm shaft and worm gear are located in the lower part of the mount, fewer counterweights are required than with conventional mounts and with some smaller OTA's no counterweight at all is required.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>The StarBook 10 controller:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The StarBook 10 system contains more than 272,000 celestial objects, including 260,000 stars from the SAO catalogue, 109 Messier objects, 7840 NGC objects and 5380 IC objects, as well the soon, moon and planets.

SK0000129-UK,ZWO AM3 Harmonic Mount Head,"<p><strong>ZWO AM3 Harmonic Equatorial Mount - GoTo Travel Mount - Mount Head. The traditional equatorial mount requires heavy counterweights. It can be difficult to keep balance in RA and DEC directions, and can be also inconvenient for transit and storage.</strong></p>
<p>To solve the above issues, ZWO developed the ASI Mount series. No need for a counterweight. With a self-weight of 3.9kg, AM3 has a large load capacity from 8kg to 13kg. While portability is very important, stability is also essential in use.

SK0000130-UK,ZWO AM5N Harmonic Mount Head,"<p><strong>The ZWO ""Harmonic Equatorial Mount AM5"" is a transportable mount designed specifically for astrophotography. The mount itself weighs less than 5kg but can carry telescopes up to 15kg without counterweight. With counterweight and the counterweight rod (optional) the mount can then carry telescopes up to 20kg in weight. Several years of development and various patents have gone into this exciting new mount and the results speak for themselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So many functions and easy operation:</strong><br>The AM5 can be operated equatorially or azimuthally. For astrophotography, the equatorial mode is normally used and the mount must be aligned as accurately as possible with the celestial pole. For visual observing or lunar and planetary photography, the altazimuth mode is more than sufficient. The status indicator always shows in which mode the mount is: Red represents equatorial mode and green represents altazimuth mode so its easy to identify at a glance.</p>
<p><strong>No more counterweights needed:</strong><br>Normally, German equatorial mounts need counterweights to balance the telescope weight and this is the only way to ensure proper operation. However the AM5 uses robotics technology and it does not require counterweights for telescopes up to 15kg. This makes the AM5 lighter, more compact and easier to operate. Only for heavier telescopes up to a maximum of 20kg, then we recommend using counterweights to keep mount and tripod in balance.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth tracking is guaranteed:</strong><br>ZWO checks and measures every AM5 mount before delivery and guarantees a periodic error (""PE"") of less than +/-20 arc seconds and in addition to this the periodic error occurs very slowly, so that the autoguider has enough time to correct it. Via ASIAIR or another software the PE can also be reduced electronically.</p>
<p><strong>Useable anywhere on Earth:</strong><br>As you would expect from a true travel mount, the AM5 can be used anywhere on Earth, from the equator to the poles and the compact design of the mount means it has room in any medium sized luggage case.</p>
<p><strong>Polar alignment of the mount for astrophotography:</strong><br>In equatorial mode, the mount needs to be aligned exactly with the celestial north or south pole but small errors are of course corrected by autoguiding. Aligning the mount can also be done quickly and easily with the ASIAIR or other suitable software.</p>
<p><strong>No more control cables thanks to WiFi:</strong><br>All functions of the mount can also be controlled via smartphone when coupled with the ASIAIR for example. With the ASIAIR, everything from the camera to autoguiding and to the mount itself can be controlled via the ASI app using a smartphone or tablet. The mount can also be separately operated with the hand controller without a smartphone if preferred.</p>
<p><strong>Supports cable management to prevent cable entanglement:</strong><br>The saddle plate now integrates DC output and Type-C port to effectively prevent cable entanglement. The unique design ensures that the internal cables will not be twisted and worn when the DEC rotates.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Important notes:</em></span></p>
<p><em>There is an ASIAIR finder shoe attached on to the side of the AM5 which is meant for attaching a polar finder scope. This finder shoe is not suitable for mounting an ASIAIR as both the cables and the antenna of the ASIAIR can be crushed during movement.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to attach this finder shoe to a different location on the mount which is more suitable, such as on the side of the Losmandy / Vixen dovetail saddle plate, then make sure not to over tighten the Hex screws fully into the side panel or you will damage the insert threads. Keep the length of the inner threads between 3-5 mm.</em></p>
<p><em>Newer mounts have M4x3.5mm screws screwed into the saddle plate, these go into the side panel when the finder shoe is attached to the saddle plate along with the M4 x 8mm screws (it will not hold with the shorter screws).</em></p>

SK0000132-UK,Askar 130PHQ Astrograph,"<p><strong>Askar 130PHQ Quadruplet APO Astrograph:<br></strong><br>The Askar 130PHQ is a long-focal-ratio, flatfield astrograph newly launched after 107PHQ. Instead of buying extra flatteners, calculating the backfocus of flattener or making tedious connection to match the distance, astrophotographers can simply equip it with any possible imaging devices, make the target stay at the focus, and then the whole optical system is perfect for imaging.</p>
<p><em>High quality imaging optics:</em><br>130PHQ has an aperture 23mm larger than 107PHQ. 130PHQ has a focal ratio of f/7.7 and a focal length of 1000mm. The Petzval-like quadruplet lens with two ED glasses offers excellent control of chromatic and other aberrations. With its self-flattening design, 130PHQ offers strong advantages in astronomical photography. It supports a medium frame 60mm image circle, has a fine spot diagram with only tiny distortion of the peripheral stars, and its central RMS radius is less than 2 microns.</p>
<p>The Askar 130PHQ is a true all-rounder with f/7.7 - it is designed as a telescope for almost all applications:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>With 1000mm focal length and the large corrected field of view, extended objects can be imaged. But equally, fine details of objects can be brought out when cameras with high resolution are used.<br>
</li>
<li>The use of different cameras with different flange focal lengths is no problem. Simply focus and you are always at the correct distance.<br>
</li>
<li>The focuser has large travel, so you can find the focus without problems.<br>
</li>
<li>The working distance or backfocus from the 2"" receptacle is long enough to use 2"" star diagonals. This turns the flatfield apo into a wide field telescope or even a planetary telescope, depending on the eyepiece used.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Practical features:</em><br>130PHQ comes with a telescopic lens hood, a high quality CNC machined and painted tube and attractive decorative parts. The rigid 3.4"" focuser comes with M68, M54, and M48 adapters and a finder base. When used with the optional 3"" 0.7x flat field reducer, the telescope can reach a focal ratio of f/5.4 and a focal length of 700mm, effectively reducing exposure time considerably. The multifunctional handle comes with a central slot for attaching an M6 screw with an M6 screw hole. It has a standard Losmandy style dovetail plate, together with sturdy double tube ring and is perfectly suited for both viewing and imaging.</p>
<p><em>The photographic 3.4"" Rack &amp; Pinion focuser:</em><br>The CNC focuser is optimized for photography and can handle a load of up to 8kg. The adjustment range is very generous. The focusing is done via rack and pinion which is decoupled from the bearing of the draw tube. This guarantees fine and precise adjustment even at maximum load. In addition to the 1.25"" and 2"" receptacle, the focuser also offers threads for screw on adaptations.</p>
<p>Every single APO is checked in the technical department before it is put into storage in order to guarantee its consistently delivered to you in the highest quality.<br></p>
<ol>
<li>The mechanics are tested and the focuser is optimally adjusted.<br>The lens is cosmetically checked and cleaned. The quality team also check that all counter screws are correctly tightened. These often loosen during transportation.<br>
</li>
<li>The optics are collimated and the result is checked on the optical bench. The telescope is given a serial number.<br>
</li>
<li>An optical test is carried out, which is enclosed with the telescope (star images and ronchi image on the optical bench in autocollimation).<br>Only then are the telescopes handed over to the warehouse and prepared for dispatch.</li>

SK0000135-UK,"Celestron - 11"" EdgeHD (Optical Tube)","<p>The EdgeHD optics (Edge High Definition) combine the compact design of a Schmidt-Cassegrain with significantly improved imaging at the edge of the image. This optical system not only offers the properties of astrographs, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view.</p>
<p>Not only is the coma outside the optical axis corrected - as with other ""coma-free"" optical designs available on the market - but also the field curvature!</p>
<p>Many optical systems are promoted as ""astrographs""; however, they produce the coveted ""pinpoint"" star image along a curved image plane. On images taken with modern CCD cameras, the result is a noticeable field curvature that increases towards the edge of the image field and becomes stronger the larger the chip is; i.e. the stars remain round, but are blown up into small rings (""donuts"") towards the edge.</p>
<p>With the Celestron Edge HD telescopes, this field curvature is corrected right up to the edge in addition to the coma, so that even images taken with large CCD chips are completely sharp, with a uniformly large star image across the entire chip - right into the corners of the image field.</p>
<p>This also significantly improves the resolution and limiting magnitude compared to competing optical systems with a similar aperture. The Celestron XLT multi-coating also helps the Edge HD optics to achieve a significant increase in performance compared to similar systems on the market.</p>

</li>
<li>Ventilation openings behind the main mirror ensure rapid air exchange, so that the optics cool down at a much faster rate. Thanks to an air filter system, no dust gets into the tube either.<br>
</li>
<li>HyperStar Compatible - All EdgeHD tubes allow you to remove the secondary mirror and replace it with the optional HyperStar optics. The result: your standard Celestron EdgeHD telescope becomes a digital Schmidt Design for your CCD or DSLR camera for prime-focus photography at f/2 (C8, C11) and f/1.9 (C14).<br>

SK0000138-UK,"Celestron - 9.25"" EdgeHD (Optical Tube)","<p>The EdgeHD optics (Edge High Definition) combine the compact design of a Schmidt-Cassegrain with significantly improved imaging at the edge of the image. This optical system not only offers the properties of astrographs, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view.</p>
<p>Not only is the coma outside the optical axis corrected - as with other ""coma-free"" optical designs available on the market - but also the field curvature!</p>
<p>Many optical systems are promoted as ""astrographs""; however, they produce the coveted ""pinpoint"" star image along a curved image plane. On images taken with modern CCD cameras, the result is a noticeable field curvature that increases towards the edge of the image field and becomes stronger the larger the chip is; i.e. the stars remain round, but are blown up into small rings (""donuts"") towards the edge.</p>
<p>With the Celestron Edge HD telescopes, this field curvature is corrected right up to the edge in addition to the coma, so that even images taken with large CCD chips are completely sharp, with a uniformly large star image across the entire chip - right into the corners of the image field.</p>
<p>This also significantly improves the resolution and limiting magnitude compared to competing optical systems with a similar aperture. The Celestron XLT multi-coating also helps the Edge HD optics to achieve a significant increase in performance compared to similar systems on the market.</p>
<p>The EdgeHD optics produce images three times flatter in the image field plane than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain. The stars are imaged diffraction-limited across the entire chip of a Nikon D3 or Canon 5D !</p>

SK0000142-UK,Bresser Star Tracker Astrophoto Mount Set,"<p><strong>Do you already own a photo camera and would like to create impressive shots of the night sky using long exposures or even making time-lapse shots of the Milkyway? Then the Bresser StarTracker Astrophoto mount set is the ideal base to work from.<br><br></strong>Unlike a conventional camera Tripod, a StarTracker mount tracks the night sky to prevent star trailing, allowing you to take very detailed and clear photos of night sky targets. <br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Not only is this mount particularly well suited for an entry into astrophotography but the built-in tracking motor rotates the saddled camera precisely against the earth's rotation and therefore the stars remain point-shaped even with long exposures. This set contains all the components required (excl. the camera) for a quick and comfortable entry into the world of astrophotography: <br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>How to get setup:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">After setting up the lightweight and compact photo mount, simply set the approximate latitude (pole height) on the tripod head MH-100 and target the polar star with the help of the optical polar finder. Then mount the camera with photo lens with the help of the quick-release plate on the heavy ball head included. With the ball head, the camera can be aligned and re-positioned at any time to any section of the sky. As soon as the tracking motor is switched on, the long exposure can be started immediately. All this takes less than 5 minutes to setup.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>Camera Suitability:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">All cameras with 1/4"" (6.3mm) tripod connection thread and the bulb B setting option for long exposure.<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Bresser photo mount is designed to carry and follow a camera with a lens of up to 2.0 kg total weight in polar mode.<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">In azimuthal mode, the mount also carries cameras with up to 5.0 kg Weight. Fast wide-angle lenses are ideal for starting off, because as the lens focal length and exposure time increase, so to do the requirements for tracking accuracy. Therefore, a shot of several minutes with a wide-angle lens can be taken without problems and the stars remain pin point sharp.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">For example, with a long focal length such as a 200mm telephoto lens, the polar alignment of the photo mount must be exactly right which can be done quickly with the integrated alignment tunnel for aligning with the polar star. Typically achievable exposure times with good tracking accuracy are: 16mm wide-angle lens: 5 minutes (300sec.) - Perfect for dramatic shots of the Milkyway and with a 100mm telephoto lens: 1 minute (60sec.)<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The tracking is carried out by a precise stepper motor which can be adjusted at different speeds via the operating menu. The low power consumption allows operation of up to 20 hours with a set of batteries or any length of time via USB connection.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>StarTracker Astrophoto Mount features:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""></p>

SK0000146-UK,ZWO ASIAIR-PLUS,"<p><strong>ZWO ASIAIR PLUS - Astrophotography has never been so easy!</strong><br><br>ASIAIR PLUS is an intelligent WiFi controller for all astrophotography applications. It replaces a laptop or an expensive stand-alone autoguider and makes the tangled cables on the telescope a thing of the past. All you need is your smartphone or a tablet, which you connect to the ASIAIR WiFi. The areas of application are diverse and include:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Control of all ZWO ASI USB 3.0 cameras - cooled cameras require an additional</li>
<li>power supply<br>
</li>
<li>Autoguiding (see user reports) in combination with a ZWO MINI camera, e.g. with</li>
<li>the ASI120 Mini<br>
</li>
<li>Control of selected mounts, e.g. from Skywatcher or iOptron<br>
</li>
<li>Control of selected DSLR and system cameras</li>
<li>Autofocusing with the ZWO EAF motor focus<br>
</li>
<li>Debayer function for ZWO color cameras<br>
</li>
<li>Image preview<br>
</li>
<li>Alignment routine<br>
</li>
<li>Planetary and lunar video recordings<br>
</li>
<li>Live Stacking<br>
</li>
<li>and much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIAIR PLUS is the third generation of the ASIAIR and is continuously being developed further by ZWO. These latest developments include:<br></p>
<ol>
<li>A built-in WiFi antenna, which significantly amplifies the signal and increases the range.<br>
</li>
<li>Four newly added indicators for the 12V DC outputs. Allows you to check the power status and monitor consumption in real time.<br>
</li>
<li>New USB-C port so you can connect the ASIAIR Plus directly to your computer to transfer data instead of going through an SD card (not included) and card reader.<br>
</li>
<li>ASIAIR Plus is now even more compact and lighter. The housing is made of aluminum and machined using CNC technology, which makes the device even more robust and durable.<br>
</li>
<li>Even better operational reliability - ASIAIR OS runs on an eMMC memory. Thanks to a new ""Auto Recovery Mode"" function, the system automatically detects errors and recovers itself.<br>
</li>
<li>The ASIAIR Plus's internal memory for images and videos is a generous 32 GB.</li>
</ol>
<p>ASIAIR PLUS Features:<br><br>Accurate Focusing: <br>After coarse focusing is completed, select a star, then accurate focusing can be done by curves such as brightness and HFD. It can also be done with ZWO EAF by remote control. <br><br>Polar Alignment: <br>Based on the powerful plate solving function, you can complete the arcsecond accurate polar axis alignment within a few minutes. <br><br>Accurate GoTo: <br>With the rich celestial object database, precise GoTo can be achieved after selecting the object.<br><br>Stable Guiding: <br>Independent and stable tracking control can be achieved without the PC. <br><br>Preview Mode: <br>You can see the image of the object directly under 'Preview'. The images will not be saved automatically. Autorun: Set the object and configure the schedule, ASIAIR will run the image sequence automatically. The images will be saved. <br><br>Live Stacking: <br>You can see the stacked image (lower noise with calibration shots) of the object directly during shooting.</p>
<p><em>Supported DSLR and mirrorless system cameras:</em><br>ASIAIR PLUS is an intelligent WiFi device that allows you to control many system cameras. A list of compatible DSLR and mirrorless system cameras can be found on the <a rel=""noopener"" title=""ASIAIR Plus Camera Compatibility"" href=""https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/wp-content/uploads/EN1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">ZWO Website here</a> . <br><br>*Note: ASIAIR does not control Astro cameras from other manufacturers, such as QHY or Explore Scientific.</p>
<p><em>Supported mounts:</em><br>ZWO has also worked closely with major manufacturers to ensure compatibility with iOptron, Vixen, Rainbow, Avalon, Explore Scientific and other models (including some new models). For now, the ASIAIR PRO supports hundreds of equatorial mounts from more than 20 manufacturers worldwide. All mounts and cameras supported by the previous version (ASIAIR) will also work with the ASIAIR PRO and ASIAIR PLUS.</p>

SK0000151-UK,Celestron Polar Wedge,"<p><strong>This Polar Wedge fits the Celestron Nexstar 6/8 SE telescopes &amp; Evolution 6/8 Telescopes, It transforms these popular telescopes into mobile platforms for astrophotography. The total weight of the Polar Wedge is 7.5kg.</strong></p>
<p>The NexStar Telescopes are generally suitable for astrophotography with longer exposure times. In azimuthal mode, tracking is achieved by movement in both axes, which is not a problem for visual observation. However, in astrophotography, a field rotation becomes noticeable after just one minute of exposure time, which initially distorts the stars at the edge of the field into lines.</p>
<p>The polar wedge eliminates this problem. It aligns the telescope's azimuth axis to the celestial pole, allowing tracking to be performed solely with the azimuth motor (there is an adjustment option in the hand controller), eliminating the need for field rotation. The wedge can be used worldwide and the tilt angle can initially be roughly adjusted using the scale, and then easily and precisely fine-tuned by hand using the fine-tuning screws with large adjustment knobs. The telescope can be easily mounted by just one person. First, attach a screw to the base and then use this screw to hook it into the paths. Then, the other two screws are inserted and tightened with an Allen key.</p>

SK0000154-UK,Pegasus Astro Ultimate Powerbox Control Hub - Gen 3,"<p><strong>Pegasus Astro Ultimate Powerbox v3 (UPBv3)</strong><br><strong>The Ultimate Powerbox V3 (UPBv3 in short) is the flagship of Pegasus Astro´s Powerbox series.</strong></p>
<p>UPBv3 is a Wi-Fi and USB controlled power hub. A USB 3.1 Hub allows you to switch on/off 8 USB ports, 8 x 12V power outlets, 2 x adjustable outputs (3-12V and 12-24V), 3 dew heaters, a stepper controller that can drive almost any stepper motor in the astronomy market silently and almost vibration-free as well as a power relay and an expansion port for devices that communicates with the UPBv3 Controller!</p>
<p>If you are tired of carrying multiple power packs and dealing with a mess of power and data cables, the Ultimate Powerbox v3, a sophisticated power control unit, is the ""Ultimate"" solution. Having all your power and data needs centralised, you minimise cables which can disturb the movements of the mount, only the main power cord and one USB data cord are attached to the Ultimate Powerbox which branches off to power all other devices.</p>
<p><em>6 x 12V DC Power outlets for your equipment:</em><br>Six powerful smart MOSFET transistors provide ""electric power"" to your equipment. Sophisticated short circuit and overload per port protections cut the power and report the incident into the software. Every MOSFET is capable of providing up to 6 amps of current.</p>
<p><em>Built-in Power Sensors:</em><br>A precise voltmeter and an ammeter (can measure up to 20A) measure and display in real-time the power input. If the input is more than 14.5V the power is instantly cut off to protect your equipment.</p>
<p><em>Individual Current Meter per 12V smart output:</em><br>Each smart 12 V output has an internal and independent digital current meter. You can view each port´s power consumption in the software.</p>
<p>Additional Power Outputs and Sensors:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>2 x Always ON 12V outputs increase the total 12V outputs to 10.<br>
</li>
<li>1 x Adjustable Voltage Step Down output can be regulated from 3V to 12V and provide up to 3 amps of power.<br>
</li>
<li>1 x Adjustable Voltage Step Up output can be regulated from 12V to 24V and provide up to 4 amps of power.<br>
</li>
<li>3 x Dew Heater outputs - the three pulse width modulation (PWM) outlets are capable of providing power to your ""thirsty"" dew heaters / flatpanels or telescope fans. Eliminate the moisture that is fuzzing your equipment and destroying your clear nights. These outlets can be remotely tuned from your laptop using the supplied software.<br>
</li>
<li>1 x Switch Relay can pass 250V / 10A and used to switch ON/OFF any 3rd party equipment.<br>
</li>
<li>A built-in ambient temperature and relative humidity sensor provides frequently readouts of the environmental conditions and automatically adjusts the heat intensity of your dew heater strips.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Embedded Stepper Motor Controller:</em><br>A silent and low vibrating stepper motor controller will precisely move your drawtube of your focuser. The controller drives a Pegasus Motor Focus Kit or almost any other stepper motor in the market (Unipolar or Bipolar) e.g. Rigel, Robofocus, Moonlight, Starlight motors. Backlash compensation is already implemented in the firmware and can be enabled, tuned and disabled from the software. A fully ASCOM6 compliant focuser driver is already available.</p>

SK0000155-UK,Celestron Power Tank Lithium - 84 Watts/h,"<p><strong>The PowerTank Lithium keeps the charge going for the astronomer on the go. The Lithium-Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery chemistry has significant advantages over other battery chemistries, including:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The LiFePO4 has an un-recharged shelf life of 10 years compared to 3 years for the Lithium Iron and 6-9 months for a Sealed Lead-Acid battery.<br>
</li>
<li>The battery performance of the PowerTank Lithium phosphate degrades at a much slower pace than other chemistries.<br>
</li>
<li>The LiFePO4 can be charged and discharged 2000 times compared to only 500 for a Lithium Iron battery and 300 for sealed lead-acid designs.<br>
</li>
<li>The batteries will last as long as the telescope you use it with!<br>
</li>
<li>The LiFePO4 uses phosphates instead of environmentally hazardous elements like cobalt or lead commonly found in other rechargeable batteries.<br>
</li>

SK0000159-UK,Nebula upgrade kit for Bresser EXOS-2 mounts,"<p><strong>So you already own a Bresser EXOS-2 mount and want to take a big step forward into the world of Astrophotography? Then the Nebula Goto Kit is exactly the upgrade that will take your Astrophotography to another level. This kit contains the same motors and control unit fitted to the premium Bresser Nebula astrophotography mounts.</strong></p>
<p>This modern system offers you several options for control. You can operate the mount directly via its own Nebula control interface using your smartphone or tablet (iOS and Android supported). Alternatively, you can also use a planetarium software like Sky Safari or Stellarium for example.</p>
<p>Of course, fully manual control remains an option too. For this, a hand controller for minor corrections or simple control commands is included in the delivery.</p>
<p>In addition, with the Bresser Nebula Goto Kit, you can connect your laptop or PC directly via WLAN or LAN cable (recommended for faster data transmission) to the Nebula control unit. This not only gives you full control over the mount, but also allows you to connect several devices such as cameras, motor focus, filter wheel, etc., directly to the control unit via various USB ports. This eliminates the need to connect each device to your computer via separate cables. The pre-installed program KStars / EKOS lets you comfortably control all devices from your PC or laptop.</p>
<p>Electronic polar alignment or guiding can also be easily implemented with the Goto Kit, provided you have a camera connected. Additionally, you are not limited to the software of the Nebula control unit. Thanks to the installed ASCOM Alpaca driver, you can use your own programs on your computer to control the mount - be it APT or N.I.N.A. The two stepper motors with belt drives ensure a smooth, direct drive of both the two axes. You just need to make sure you mount is correctly balanced.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Belt drive for more precise, quieter tracking<br>
</li>
<li>Stepper motors with high resolution (0.36´/microstep)<br>
</li>

SK0000168-UK,Explore Scientific (8 x 50) Guide Scope / Finder Scope with Helical Focuser,"<p><strong>This universal 50mm Guide Scope &amp; Finder Scope has a focal length of 220mm and although initialy designed for the Explore Scientific range, its also suitable for use on a wide range of other telescopes. </strong></p>
<p>This excellent 8x50 Finder Scope has a detachable eyepiece unit and crosshairs with adjustable red illumination for ease of use in the dark. The very precise helical focuser has many connection possibilities such as a 1.25"" / 31.7mm plug-in connector, as well as the T2 camera connection thread (M42x0.75mm) to enable the autoguiding camera required for long exposure astrophotography. It can even be used as a small mini travel telescope.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The scope viewfinder also has a very large field of view (FOV) of 6.96 degrees, making it much easier to search for and target objects. The existing scale markers (division =1 degree) of the crosshairs are a good reference for estimating distances and the open center marking also facilitates the precise centering of objects. All the lens surfaces have a multi-coating and guarantee a bright viewfinder image due to the high light transmission values. The adjustable red LED lighting is powered by two LR41 button cells. The main lens and crosshairs can be focused independently, giving you perfect focus for your eyes.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Compact tracking unit for Auto-guiding:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">One of the main applications for this telescope is auto-guiding. For this purpose, the Guide Scope is inserted into the existing scope shoe of the primary optics and aligned in parallel. If the existing scope shoe is not compatible, a second shoe is also included. A tracking camera can be mounted with the 1.25 inch/31.7mm plug-in connector at the rear of the scope or via T2 threaded connection (M42x0.75mm) - Please note the required back focus for your tracking camera. The focus plane (or back focus) is about 22mm behind the T2 thread. The precision focuser allows you to focus sharply onto the guide star and for easy repetition of the focus point, the focus tube has a white millimeter scale of 0 to 28mm laserd on top.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Use as a mini travel telescope:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">This Finder / Guide Scope can also be easily used as a mini travel telescope. A magnification of x 8 to x 40 can be achieved with optionally available eyepieces. Almost all eyepieces with an eyepiece focal length of 5 to 26mm and 1.25 inch/31.7mm plug-in connection type are suitable.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Metal viewfinder holder and viewfinder shoe:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The base holder of the viewfinder and guide telescope is made entirely of aluminum and forms a stable base. If the existing viewfinder shoe is not compatible, a suitable viewfinder shoe which is included can be attached to the OTA using 4 x M5 screws. The bore distances of the viewfinder shoe on the longitudinal and transverse axis are 31.7mm.

<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Note</span>: These Telescopes are ordered directly from the Manufacturer which can have an additional lead time. Feel free to contact us for more info if needed.</em></p>
<p>The Z4 is a sextuplet astrograph with three pieces of lens at the front and three pieces at the back, and two of them are ED glasses.</p>
<p>Just like other Sharpstar astrographs, the Z4 is designed as self-flattening so there is no need to calculate the back focus. You can just focus the target and the optical system is perfectly corrected for imaging. It is especially ideal for capturing stunning wide-field images of the deep sky over a 36mm (APS-C) sized image circle, however the Z4 is not recommended for use with full-frame cameras.</p>
<p>The tube ring has a handle on the top which makes it easy to carry and assemble. The handle is also designed as a slot where you can mount a finder base etc.</p>
<p>The entire tube has a length of just 482mm with the dew shield retracted and it weighs just 4.3kg. It has a back focus of 77mm, so common M48-rings will work fine when using DSLR cameras or you can use astronomical cameras with accessories.</p>
<p>The Z4 uses a large 3.4"" focuser with a 1:10 fine adjustment knob and a 360° rotator for easy focusing and angle adjustment. It has M86, M68, M54, M48 adapters, and the M48 one has an internal thread that can fit 2"" filters.</p>
<p>A 300mm Vixen-style dovetail plate also makes it easier to balance on the equatorial mount.</p>

However, compared to the 61EDPH II, it has an upgraded two pieces low dispersion ED glass for more excellent imaging performance. 61EDPH III (without reducer) has a focal length of 360mm, a focal ratio of f5.9, and supports the 44mm full-frame image circle. Its also a high-quality portable telescope.</p>
<p>The 61EDPH III upgraded the handle of the 61EDPH II to a multifunctional handle, which provides an additional universal Vixen style finder base. In addition to this, the 61EDPH III is equipped with a 200mm long Vixen style dovetail plate, easier to connect to the equatorial mounts and accessories, and makes the OTA easier to balance on the mount. As before, the tube uses high-quality CNC machining, high-grade surface painting, and polished oxidation, which is both elaborate and durable.</p>
<p><strong>The x0.75 Reducer (included)</strong></p>
<p>The special full-frame reducer: On this reducer, one end of the reducer features an M68×1 thread to connect to the focuser drawtube, the other end of the reducer has an M48×0.75 male thread with built-in 2"" filter thread. The back focus is 55mm. If it needs to be extended, this reducer can also be split to reveal an M54×0.75 female thread, and then the back focus becomes 75mm. The reducer adopts an air-spaced quadruplet structure, supporting full-frame imaging. With the reducer installed, the focal ratio of 61EDPH III is reduced to f/4.5 and the focal length reduced to 270mm.</p>
<p>An optional full-frame flattener and a full-frame reducer are available for the 61EDPH III, providing users with even more options:<br>The special full-frame flattener: One end of the flattener features an M68×1 male thread to connect to the focuser drawtube, the other end of the flattener has an M48×0.75 male thread with built-in 2"" filter thread. The back focus is 55mm. If it needs to be extended further, the flattener can be split to reveal an M54×0.75 female thread, and the back focus becomes 81.5mm. The flattener adopts an air-spaced triplet structure, the peripheral light reduction control is excellent and can effectively improve the curvature of the field which improves the corner image quality, and reduces aberrations.</p>

SK0000185-UK,"Celestron NexStar Evolution - 6"" SC","<p><strong>Celestron's computer-controlled telescopes reach the next level with the NexStar Evolution: the first Schmidt-Cassegrains with built-in WiFi. You no longer need a hand controller - point the telescope at the most beautiful celestial objects with a click on your smartphone or tablet. </strong></p>
<p>Connect your mobile device to the wireless network of your NexStar Evolution telescope and explore the universe with the Celestron app for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>The planetarium program on your smartphone shows you the current sky view or a list of observation targets for your location. The easy-to-use SkyAlign is integrated into the Celestron app, so you can set up the telescope and adjust the three reference stars in just a few minutes.</p>
<p><em>Simple and convenient operation:</em><br>The NexStar Evolution telescopes have been developed based on customer feedback from the past few years. They offer many well thought-out details so that you can enjoy the most beautiful night possible under the starry sky. </p>
<p>No more worrying about batteries or an external power supply. The NexStar Evolution is the first amateur telescope to have a built-in lithium iron phosphate battery. One charge lasts up to ten hours. You can even use the Evolution's USB port to power other devices you want to use at night.</p>
<p>The NexStar Evolution is easy to set up thanks to the large, ergonomic handles. The steel tripod has markings so you can easily extend all legs to the same length. The azimuth and elevation clamps allow you to point the telescope at a target even without power. Up to seven eyepieces can be stored in two storage compartments - one even has a dimmable red LED light.</p>
<p>More power and safety thanks to lithium iron phosphate battery:<br>Instead of a typical lithium polymer battery, a lithium iron phosphate battery is used in the Evolution telescopes. These LiFePO 4 batteries have several advantages over simple LiPo batteries:</p>
<p><strong>High safety &amp; Reliability:</strong><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike LiPo batteries, LiFePO 4 batteries cannot explode or ignite, but are considered intrinsically safe. The improved power density ensures a high load capacity even with continuous current consumption.<br>
</li>
<li>Long service life and cycle stability.<br>
</li>
<li>Wide temperature range for storage and operation<br>
</li>
<li>Low self-discharge<br>
</li>
<li>Excellent tracking accuracy, suitable for astrophotography</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in astrophotography, a NexStar Evolution is an excellent and affordable way to get started. It's the only fork-mounted telescope series in this price range with worm gears, along with improved motors. Planetary photography with a DSLR or a planetary camera is also no problem at all, and with a polar wedge you can also set it up equatorially to take long exposure deep sky images, be it with a DSLR or an Astro Camera.</p>
<p>The Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes with the StarBright XLT coating deliver bright, sharp images and are just as interesting for visual observers as they are for astrophotographers.</p>
<p>The NexStar Evolution telescopes come with a StarPointer finder scope, two 1.25” Plössl eyepieces, a star diagonal, power supply and a hand controller.</p>

SK0000186-UK,"TS-Optics N-AG Newtonian - 14""","<p><strong>TS Optics 14"" f/5.13 Newtonian Astrograph is an excellent telescope for Astrophotographers who want to use a CCD camera or a DSLR camera with large sensors. It also offers a fully corrected and illuminated image field of 54mm diameter.</strong></p>
<p><em>Telescopes for astrophotography without compromises:</em><br></p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality carbon fiber tube made in Germany - manufactured as carbon fiber hard foam sandwich for optimal stiffness at low weight. The telescope obtains its optimal temperature properties from the carbon fiber materials therefore with medium temperature changes, refocusing is not necessary anymore.<br>
</li>
<li>The Primary and secondary mirror cell are also made in Germany. The entire collimation of the telescope can be done without tools.<br>
</li>
<li>Very effective 3.0"" dual-speed focuser - this focuser clamps 3"" accessories together and it also allows for screwed connections.<br>
</li>
<li>The built in N-AGK3 3"" coma corrector provides some of the best illumination of all 3"" correctors - it's suitable for all common sensors and perfectly suitable for high-resolution sensors right up to very large format sensors. The attachment to the M68 x 1 ZEISS style adapter thread is included.<br>
</li>
<li>High-quality primary and secondary mirror for maximum sharpness. After assembling, every N-AG14 is checked on the optical bench prior to shipping and a production journal is included with every telescope.<br>
</li>
<li>The edge of the secondary is also well blackened to prevent stray light and reflexes.<br>
</li>
<li>CNC machined metal tube rings offer the best stability and elegant design and mounting to dovetail bars is done via female M6 threads.<br>
</li>
<li>The N-AG14 Astrographs also offer two further focus positions for all common 2"" and 3"" correctors.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Anti-reflex paint for maximal contrast:</em><br>Berger Anti reflex colour paint is used as it darkens the inner wall of the tube. Apart from the lower weight, the main advantage is that the paint produces almost no rust and the optics stay perfectly clean.</p>
<p><em>Connecting your CCD camera to the telescope:</em><br>The N-AG14 Astrograph offers a generous working distance of 69.3mm from the M68 x 1 connecting thread.</p>
<p><em>Important note for using full-frame DSLR cameras:</em><br>Every N-AG14 Astrograph is made to use cameras with large sensors. However, you will see vignetting when using DSLR cameras. This comes from the body of the camera or from the adaption via the M48 adapter. By using flats, you can eliminate this vignetting. Full-frame CCD cameras are not affected by it, as the distance to the sensor is bigger and the cameras usually have a larger connection thread.</p>
<p><strong>Spec:</strong><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Aperture: 358 mm / 14""<br>
</li>
<li>Focal ratio (without corrector): f/4.5<br>
</li>
<li>Effective focal ratio: f/5.1 (due to the extension factor of the corrector)<br>
</li>
<li>Focal length: 1837mm<br>
</li>
<li>Primary mirror: Mirror substrate Pyrex, conical<br>
</li>
<li>Secondary mirror: Diameter 104mm minor axis<br>

SK0000187-UK,"TS-Optics UNC f/4 Newtonian - 12""","<p><strong>The TS Optics UNC Newtonian series offers an alternative to Newtonians made in the far east. With these telescopes you do not have to settle for any compromises. UNC stands for Universal Newtonian telescope with Carbon tube. Each UNC Newtonian is individually manufactured for you in Germany. </strong></p>
<p><strong>These Telescopes are specially made to order.</strong></p>
<p>The 10"" f/4 UNC Newtonian is a versatile and relatively compact telescope for portable and stationary use. The high speed of f/4 makes the Newtonian the ideal telescope for astrophotography. We recommend an EQ6 or CGEM mount, which comfortably holds a Newtonian of this size with good stability when used for astrophotography.</p>
<p>Checkout some examples of photos taken with this Telescope on <a href=""https://app.astrobin.com/equipment/explorer/telescope/556/ts-optics-300mm12-unc-f4-newtonian-carbon-tube"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Astrobin here</a><a href=""https://app.astrobin.com/equipment/explorer/telescope/554/ts-optics-250mm10-unc-f4-newtonian-carbon-tube"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""></a> &gt;</p>
<p><em>The advantages of the TS UNC Newtonian telescope:</em><em></em></p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality carbon tube made in Germany with maximum stability - customized manufacturing to suit your needs.<br>
</li>
<li>Optimized focus position as desired and therefore also best possible illumination<br>Primary mirror cell and secondary mirror cell has been further improved by Teleskop-Service in Germany<br>
</li>
<li>Easy collimation of primary and secondary mirror - by hand, without tools<br>
</li>
<li>The edge of the secondary mirror is blackened<br>
</li>
<li>TS Rack and Pinion focuser with M54 x 0.75 intermediate thread, also suitable for heavy cameras<br>
</li>
<li>The secondary is attached to the secondary mirror mount with the correct offset before its shipped to you.<br>
</li>
<li>94% reflectivity on primary mirror and secondary mirror for a brighter image<br>
</li>
<li>Diffraction limited primary mirror - each individual telescope is tested on an optical bench before shipment</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Every UNC Newtonian is darkened inside:</em><br>The tube inner side of the UNC Newtonian telescopes is darkened which prevents reflections and provides better contrast. The TS ""Black"" anti-reflective paint or a velour film is used. The result is a matte black tube interior. Velour film and the TS ""Black"" have a similar effect and darken better than the commonly used chalkboard paint.</p>
<p><em>The Carbon Tube - finest precision work:</em><br>The carbon tube is extra solid and completely reinforced, and not only around the focuser which makes the tube much stiffer. The openings for the secondary spider vanes are precisely fitted with turned mating parts, to ensure that the secondary spider vanes are correct and the telescope produces perfect spikes right from the start.</p>
<p><em>Focus position optimized for astrophotography:</em><br>The focus point is 135mm above the tube. This allows you to use different focusers and still have a comfortable working distance. With the standard focuser you even get 80mm working distance, which even allows the use of focal reducers or a binoviewer with moderate glass path compensation. For standard correctors like the Baader MPCC or the TS-Optics MAXFIELD corrector we recommend the 20mm spacer, which goes between the focuser. This gives you 60mm backfocus. Note: For visual observations you need a 2"" extension tube.</p>
<p><em>The 2"" TS UNCN2-G2 focuser:</em><br>A core component of the TS UNC-Newtons is the modern TS UNCN2-G2 focuser. The focuser builds up only 58mm from the tube edge and still carries heavy cameras and accessories without tilting. This type of focuser is also far superior to conventional Crayford focusers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Focuser Features:</strong><br>
</li>
<li>High stiffness with extremely short length<br>
</li>
<li>Precise 1:10 dual-speed gear - for perfectly focused Astrophotographs<br>
</li>
<li>The adjustment is decoupled from the ball bearing - a clear advantage over Crayford focusers<br>
</li>
<li>Can be adapted with motorized focusers<br>
</li>
<li>The ball bearings are adjustable, so the focuser tension can be adjusted perfectly - but its delivered with the focuser already optimally adjusted.<br>
</li>
<li>Accessories can be screwed on - the 2"" receptacle can be unscrewed, providing you with an M54 x 0.75 female thread.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>More information about the focuser UNCN2-G2:</em></p>
<p><em>Parabolic primary mirror:</em><br>Newtonian primary mirrors made of fused silica are free of strain and provide an image that is usually even much better than diffraction limited. The surface is coated with an enhanced 94% reflection layer and a protective quartz layer. The primary mirror has a central marking as an adjustment aid.</p>
<p><em>Primary mirror fan for faster cool-down:</em><br>A fan accelerates the cooling down to ambient temperature. As long as a mirror has not cooled down properly, it generates warm air currents that degrade the image - regardless of which mirror substrate is used. This effect only stops once the mirror has cooled down.</p>
<p>Every TS Carbon Newtonian is tested on an optical bench before shipping:<br>After assembly, each UNC Newtonian is subjected to an optical test in the workshop before shipping. This ensures that the telescope will adapt perfectly with your accessories and also delivers the optical performance you expect.</p>
<p>Before shipping, the primary mirror with the cell is removed from the tube and packed separately. This is done to ensure a safer shipment and avoid unnecessary transport damages.</p>

SK0000188-UK,"TS-Optics UNC f/4 Newtonian - 10""","<p><strong>The TS Optics UNC Newtonian series offers an alternative to Newtonians made in the far east. With these telescopes you do not have to settle for any compromises. UNC stands for Universal Newtonian telescope with Carbon tube. Each UNC Newtonian is individually manufactured for you in Germany. </strong></p>
<p><strong>These Telescopes are specially made to order.</strong></p>
<p>The 10"" f/4 UNC Newtonian is a versatile and relatively compact telescope for portable and stationary use. The high speed of f/4 makes the Newtonian the ideal telescope for astrophotography. We recommend an EQ6 or CGEM mount, which comfortably holds a Newtonian of this size with good stability when used for astrophotography.</p>
<p>Checkout some examples of photos taken with this Telescope on <a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://app.astrobin.com/equipment/explorer/telescope/554/ts-optics-250mm10-unc-f4-newtonian-carbon-tube"" target=""_blank"">Astrobin here</a> &gt;</p>
<p><em>The advantages of the TS UNC Newtonian telescope:</em><em></em></p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality carbon tube made in Germany with maximum stability - customized manufacturing to suit your needs.<br>
</li>
<li>Optimized focus position as desired and therefore also best possible illumination<br>Primary mirror cell and secondary mirror cell has been further improved by Teleskop-Service in Germany<br>
</li>
<li>Easy collimation of primary and secondary mirror - by hand, without tools<br>
</li>
<li>The edge of the secondary mirror is blackened<br>
</li>
<li>TS Rack and Pinion focuser with M54 x 0.75 intermediate thread, also suitable for heavy cameras<br>
</li>
<li>The secondary is attached to the secondary mirror mount with the correct offset before its shipped to you.<br>
</li>
<li>94% reflectivity on primary mirror and secondary mirror for a brighter image<br>
</li>
<li>Diffraction limited primary mirror - each individual telescope is tested on an optical bench before shipment</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Every UNC Newtonian is darkened inside:</em><br>The tube inner side of the UNC Newtonian telescopes is darkened which prevents reflections and provides better contrast. The TS ""Black"" anti-reflective paint or a velour film is used. The result is a matte black tube interior. Velour film and the TS ""Black"" have a similar effect and darken better than the commonly used chalkboard paint.</p>
<p><em>The Carbon Tube - finest precision work:</em><br>The carbon tube is extra solid and completely reinforced, and not only around the focuser which makes the tube much stiffer. The openings for the secondary spider vanes are precisely fitted with turned mating parts, to ensure that the secondary spider vanes are correct and the telescope produces perfect spikes right from the start.</p>
<p><em>Focus position optimized for astrophotography:</em><br>The focus point is 135mm above the tube. This allows you to use different focusers and still have a comfortable working distance. With the standard focuser you even get 80mm working distance, which even allows the use of focal reducers or a binoviewer with moderate glass path compensation. For standard correctors like the Baader MPCC or the TS-Optics MAXFIELD corrector we recommend the 20mm spacer, which goes between the focuser. This gives you 60mm backfocus. Note: For visual observations you need a 2"" extension tube.</p>
<p><em>The 2"" TS UNCN2-G2 focuser:</em><br>A core component of the TS UNC-Newtons is the modern TS UNCN2-G2 focuser. The focuser builds up only 58mm from the tube edge and still carries heavy cameras and accessories without tilting. This type of focuser is also far superior to conventional Crayford focusers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Focuser Features:</strong><br>
</li>
<li>High stiffness with extremely short length<br>
</li>
<li>Precise 1:10 dual-speed gear - for perfectly focused Astrophotographs<br>
</li>
<li>The adjustment is decoupled from the ball bearing - a clear advantage over Crayford focusers<br>
</li>
<li>Can be adapted with motorized focusers<br>
</li>
<li>The ball bearings are adjustable, so the focuser tension can be adjusted perfectly - but its delivered with the focuser already optimally adjusted.<br>
</li>
<li>Accessories can be screwed on - the 2"" receptacle can be unscrewed, providing you with an M54 x 0.75 female thread.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>More information about the focuser UNCN2-G2:</em></p>
<p><em>Parabolic primary mirror:</em><br>Newtonian primary mirrors made of fused silica are free of strain and provide an image that is usually even much better than diffraction limited. The surface is coated with an enhanced 94% reflection layer and a protective quartz layer. The primary mirror has a central marking as an adjustment aid.</p>
<p><em>Primary mirror fan for faster cool-down:</em><br>A fan accelerates the cooling down to ambient temperature. As long as a mirror has not cooled down properly, it generates warm air currents that degrade the image - regardless of which mirror substrate is used. This effect only stops once the mirror has cooled down.</p>
<p>Every TS Carbon Newtonian is tested on an optical bench before shipping:<br>After assembly, each UNC Newtonian is subjected to an optical test in the workshop before shipping. This ensures that the telescope will adapt perfectly with your accessories and also delivers the optical performance you expect.</p>
<p>Before shipping, the primary mirror with the cell is removed from the tube and packed separately. This is done to ensure a safer shipment and avoid unnecessary transport damages.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Choose your focus positions and secondary mirror diameter:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(37, 163, 34);""><strong>Focus position No. 1</strong></span>: Set 60mm above the 2"" receptacle has proven to be very versatile. It is the standard position. Nevertheless, we can also offer you individual focus positions and other secondary mirror sizes at no extra charge:<br>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(37, 163, 34);""><strong>Focus position No. 2</strong></span>: Set 30mm above the 2"" receptacle - optimal for visual observation or for correctors with focal length extension, such as the PARACORR from TeleVue. The secondary mirror will be slightly smaller.<br>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(37, 163, 34);""><strong>Focus position No. 3</strong></span>: Set 90mm above the 2"" receptacle - this allows you to use the TS2KORRR 0.73x Reducer/Corrector and improve the telescope speed.

SK0000190-UK,"TS Hyperbolic Ritchey-Chrétien - 6""","<p><strong>TS GSO 6"" f/9 RC Ritchey-Chrétien Telescope.</strong></p>
<p>Most large professional telescope are designed and constructed to the Ritchey-Chrétien principle. Until recently, these telescopes were unaffordable for amateurs as they are quite difficult and complex to produce, due to their unique design, Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes are primarily aimed to amateur astronomers with an interest in high resolution Astrophotography however an RC can also still be used for visual observing with an eyepiece if needed.</p>
<p><strong>How to reach focus on the 6"" RC:</strong><br>Without extension sleeves, the back focus from the 2"" connection is about 159mm. But included are three M90 extension sleeves (1x 50mm 2x 25mm) which are simply screwed between the focuser and the tube. This allows you to focus any accessory needed such as 1.25"" and 2"" zenith mirrors and also various correctors and most common cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Astrophotography with the TS 6"" RC telescope:<br></strong>Better and sharper astro photos without a corrector and with shorter exposure times is exactly what this Ritchey-Chrétien telescope allows you to do with astro cameras and SLRs up to APS-C sensors. As a pure mirror system, you can even use the infrared light. You can achieve up to 25% shorter exposure times and sharper imaging than, for example, through a comparable Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. For the use of a reflex camera without focal length reduction you need the 50mm and the 25mm extension between focuser and telescope.</p>
<p>The generous backfocus also allows the connection of correctors (which we recommend for the use of full-frame sensors). You can also connect a focal length reducer, thus further increasing the light intensity of the Ritchey-Chrétien.</p>
<p><strong>Accessories - 0.67x CCD reducer for Astrophotography:</strong><br>The <a href=""https://www.horizonastronomy.ie/en-de/products/ts-optics-x0-67-ccd47-reducer?_pos=1&amp;_sid=5e6823e7c&amp;_ss=r"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CCD47 reducer</a> improves the focal ratio from f/9 to f/5.96, therefore reducing the exposure time by around 50%. With this, you can capture dim nebulae and galaxies with more moderate exposure times.</p>
<p><strong>Primary and secondary mirror of quartz glass with 94% enhanced reflectivity:</strong><br>Quartz glass does not change its dimensions if temperature changes. When the temperature changes slowly during an exposure, other mirror substrates, like Pyrex, tend to a deformation of the mirror and thus to a shift of the focus. This problem does not exist for mirrors of quartz glass. Therefore the focus is better maintained which is very important for long exposures. Both mirrors are coated with 94% reflectivity material which means the image is obviously brighter than many other designs with only 90% reflection.</p>
<p><strong>The advantages of TS Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes for Astrophotography:</strong><br>The TS RC astrographs are true Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes. Maksutovs and Schmidt-Cassegrains have spherical mirrors and need correctors for making a large field usable. With Schmidt-Cassegrains, you can see the aberrations in the field even when working visually. Most times, Maksutov-Cassegrains are so slow that they are not suitable for astrophotography. RC telescopes have hyperbolical primary and secondary mirrors. They are more difficult to manufacture, but offer a significantly sharper field with less aberrations throughout the field.</p>
<p><strong>What makes the Ritchey-Chrétien Telescope superior to Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes for Astrophotography:</strong><br>Schmidt-Cassegrains generally require a corrector for Astrophotography. Additionally, these telescopes have a Schmidt plate at the front side which is prone to dew. The RC is a pure reflection system without lenses in the light path. Thus you can use the complete light even in the infrared range. The image is brighter and the exposure times get shorter. The field of an RC telescope is coma-free by design and relatively flat.</p>
<p><strong>No shifting problem with TS RC telescopes:</strong><br>Telescopes with focusing via a movable primary mirror often suffer from mirror shifting problems. The image shifts while focusing or even jumps. TS Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes do not have this problem, as their primary mirror is fixed. Focusing is done via a high-quality focuser. An additional advantage is the optimal distance from primary to secondary mirror which gives you the guarantee of the best possible image if the primary mirror moves relative to the secondary, you will almost never have the optimal distance.</p>

SK0000191-UK,"TS Hyperbolic Ritchey-Chrétien - 8""","<p><strong>TS GSO 8"" f/8 RC Ritchey-Chrétien Telescope with Carbon Tube.</strong></p>
<p>Most large professional telescope are designed and constructed to the Ritchey-Chrétien principle. Until recently, these telescopes were unaffordable for amateurs. Due to their unique design, Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes are primarily aimed to amateur astronomers with an interest in high resolution Astrophotography however an RC can also still be used for visual observing with an eyepiece if needed.</p>
<p><strong>The advantages of the TS RC Telescopes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hyperbolic primary and secondary mirror for a large fully illuminated field of view.<br>
</li>
<li>Astrophotography with camera sensors up to 30mm diameter is possible without corrector. For larger sensors, like full-frame size, a specialised corrector is available.<br>
</li>
<li>94% enhanced reflectivity on the main and secondary mirror for an even brighter image.<br>
</li>
<li>Significantly shorter cooling down time due to open construction<br>
</li>
<li>Internal baffles in the tube for even more contrast.<br>
</li>
<li>High back focus for correctors, reducers and also binoviewers.<br>
</li>
<li>Due to a redesign of the baffle tube, problems with stray light no longer occurs. Nevertheless, the illumination is still very good. Sensors up to full frame format can be used.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Astrophotography with the TS  8"" RC telescope:<br></strong>Better and sharper astrophotos without a corrector and with shorter exposure times is exactly what this Ritchey-Chrétien telescope allows you to do with astro cameras and SLRs up to APS-C sensors. As a pure mirror system, you can even use the infrared light.

<p><strong>Accessories - 0.67x CCD reducer for Astrophotography:<br></strong>The <a href=""https://www.horizonastronomy.ie/en-de/products/ts-optics-x0-67-ccd47-reducer?_pos=1&amp;_sid=5e6823e7c&amp;_ss=r"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CCD47 reducer</a> improves the focal ratio from f/8 to f/5.36, thus reducing the exposure time to less than 50%. With this, you can capture dim nebulae and galaxies with more moderate exposure times.</p>
<p><strong>The advantages of a carbon tube over a metal tube:<br></strong>The weight reduction is minimal - only about 300 grams - the main advantage is the focus stability when temperature changes which is important for Astrophotography. When temperatures drop, metal contracts and the focus moves meaning refocusing is necessary. A carbon tube does not change, the combination of quartz glass mirror and carbon composite tube makes a readjustment of the sharpness obsolete, even for long time exposures.</p>
<p><strong>The 2"" Monorail focuser:<br></strong>The Monorail focuser combines the ease of movement of a Crayford focuser with the stiffness of a rack-and-pinion focuser.</p>

SK0000196-UK,Vixen SXD2-R200SS Newtonian Reflector,"<strong>The very fast f/4 200mm optics of the R200SS has a parabolic primary mirror and provides extremely sharp images without chromatic aberration. The use of a special coating (state-of-the-art technology) provides an optimal surface for Celestial observations and astrophotography of deep-sky objects.</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The large aperture and the short design make this device ideal for astrophotography of nebulae, star clusters and comets and the focuser has a holder for 2"" eyepieces - larger eyepieces of course means more light and less vignetting. The R200SS also comes with 232mm pipe clamps and Vixen dovetail rail.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Aluminum Vacuum Evaporation System:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Vixen has a unique aluminum vacuum evaporation system that creates extremely precise mirror surfaces. This very unique Vixen system enables the controlled coating of the primary mirror and therefore achieves much higher accuracy thank many other designs in this class.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The SXD2 mount comes with the new Starbook Ten controller and the PFL-II polar finder, which allows the mount to be aligned quickly and easily via reference stars. With a combination of the best features of the Sphinx series and the new Starbook Ten controller, Vixen has developed a new generation of SX mounts for demanding observers and astrophotographers alike.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The SXD2 is quieter and quieter in its tracking than the previous SX mounts and the increased precision of the motors allows for improved performance during long exposures in astrophotography. Precision stepper motors and the micro-step motion control system are at the heart of the SXD2, which offer even better performance and response times than other mount models.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The bearings of the R.A. and DEC axes and the worm shafts have been significantly improved to reduce the load on the motors. This makes the movement of the mount extremely quiet and more robust R.A. and DEC shafts increase the performance and overall robustness of the SXD2 mount.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>The STARBOOK TEN controller features:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Large LCD color monitor:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The LCD monitior of the STAR BOOK TEN has a 5 inch TFT Color Liquid crystal display with high WVGA (800×480 pixels, 65,535 colors) resolution.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Functional Moon Map:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The latest version of the STAR BOOK TEN firmware includes a ""Moon Map"" function. This allows the user to view a map of the visible part of the moon on the screen. All major landmarks on the surface of the moon are highlighted and can be selected for the GoTo feature.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Night mode in red:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">During astronomical observations at night, the eyes of the observer adapt to the darkness. The observer sees less of the night sky because bright white light reduces this dark adaptation of the eyes. For this reason, the display of the Starbook Ten can be switched to red backlight. The red light does not affect this dark adaptation as much as white light.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Illuminated buttons:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">All command and direction buttons can be illuminated in red so that you can keep track even in the dark. The illuminated buttons can be switched on or off.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Fast CPU:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Starbook Ten has a CPU with 324 MHz clock frequency, which is about 5 times as fast as the CPU of the old STAR BOOK. This will make the star map load faster and make the screen more vivid.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Simple menu:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">With the STAR BOOK TEN you can call up your celestial bodies in both scope and chart mode. In addition, you can select your objects by scrolling the star map in chart mode. Frequently used menus can be found on any of the ten buttons. This allows you to quickly and easily reach the most important functions directly at the touch of a button.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Object Database:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The STAR BOOK TEN contains more than 270,000 celestial objects, including 258,977 stars from the SAO star catalog, 109 Messier objects, 7,840 objects and NGC 5386 IC objects, the sun, the moon and the planets of our solar system. Simply call the objects with their common names.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>P-PEC function:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">You can save a periodic error correction to improve tracking accuracy of the mount. This is stored and retained even if you turn off the device and put it back into operation the next time.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>On the hunt for satellites:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">You can enter the orbital elements of a satellite directly into the Starbook via the LAN connection of a PC. You can store up to 10 satellites in your Starbook.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Viewing Comets:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">You can enter the orbital elements of a comet directly into the Starbook via a LAN connection of a PC.

You can enter position data of up to 10 objects directly on the Starbook Ten or via the LAN connection of a PC.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Multiple tracking speeds:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">It is possible to change the speed rate according to the type of object you are observing. The movement of the sun, moon, planets or comets can be tracked at different speeds.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Advanced alignment algorithm:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">You can achieve an exact alignment of the mount by simply approaching 2 stars with a distance of at least 10 degrees one after the other and saving them. You can enter the position data of up to 20 stars on the Starbook Ten controller.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The more stars you store, the more accurate the positioning of the mount will become. If you save more than 20 stars, existing position data will be deleted The Starbook Ten memory has a large backup storage in which your information can be stored. This allows you to turn off the device and conserve the batteries. When the mount resumes its work, the data remains stored.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Atmospheric refraction:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">This option allows you to compensate for or reduce atmospheric refraction on the celestial objects near the horizon.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Cross Over Meridian:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The mount has a safety function that rotates the optical tube in the opposite direction when the observation object comes to its highest position to prevent the optics from hitting the mount.

SK0000199-UK,"Vixen VMC200L Maksutov-Cassegrain OTA - 8""","<p>This high-precision Maksutov-Cassegrain offers simply incredible views of the moon and the planets - Something Maksutov designs are especially renowned for. A specially coated spherical mirror enables an extremely sharp image and at 8"" diameter and 1950mm focal length, this enables extremely clear and high resolution views of the moon and planets, particularly some of the larger ones like Jupiter &amp; Saturn.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Due to the open system (i.e no front lens), the optics cool down faster and therefore adjust to temperature changes more quickly. This is important as closed systems such as Schmidt Cassegrain designs can need regular re-focusing due to temperature differences.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The extremely short length of only 510mm makes the telescope very transportable. Vixen has a unique aluminum vacuum evaporation system that creates extremely precise mirror surfaces and the revolutionary Vixen system allows the controlled coating of the primary mirror achieving incredibly high contrast and detail.

SK0000200-UK,"Vixen VMC260L Maksutov-Cassegrain OTA - 10""","This high-precision Maksutov-Cassegrain offers simply incredible views of the moon and the planets - Something Maksutov designs are especially renowned for. A specially coated spherical mirror enables an extremely sharp image and at 10"" diameter and 3000mm focal length, this provides simply spectacularly clear and high resolution views of the moon and planets.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Due to the open system (i.e no front lens), the optics cool down faster and therefore adjust to temperature changes more quickly. This is important as closed systems such as Schmidt Cassegrain designs can need regular re-focusing due to temperature differences.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The extremely short length of only 650mm makes the telescope very transportable. Vixen has a unique aluminum vacuum evaporation system that creates extremely precise mirror surfaces and the revolutionary Vixen system allows the controlled coating of the primary mirror achieving incredibly high contrast and detail. This same coating is also used in both the VMV200/VC200L and the R200SS.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>Features:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">

SK0000203-UK,"TS Optics Super Plössl Eyepiece - 1.25"" (Various Sizes)","Super Plössl eyepieces have been very popular among amateur astronomers for a long time. TS Optics Super Plössl eyepieces are perfect for amateur astronomers who put emphasis on a good image sharpness and detail which is also as bright as possible.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>The advantages of the TS Super Plössl eyepieces at a glance:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<ol>
<li>Extremely high quality optics compared to many basic eyepieces.</li>
<li>No ""tunnel vision"" effect through the 52° apparent field of view.</li>
<li>Multi-coated on all air-to-glass surfaces for maximum contrast and image brightness</li>
<li>Blackened lens edges prevent reflections.</li>
<li>1.25"" barrel with thread for 1.25"" filters - fits straight into telescopes with a 1.25"" eyepiece connection, or using a 2"" to 1.25"" reducer for larger telescopes.</li>
<li>Foldable rubber eyecups - ideal if you wear glasses.</li>
</ol>
<em>TS-Optics Super Plössl eyepieces for astrophotography:</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">These optics offer high contrast and fine internal blackening which make the TS Super Plössl eyepieces also suitable for astrophotography. You can even remove the rubber eyecup and directly attach the camera T2 adapter (see optional accessories) for effective eyepiece projection.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">It is extremely important how much light reaches the observer through the optics, especially when viewing weak nebulae and galaxies and this light transmission can mean the difference between the object being clearly visible or not visible.

SK0000217-UK,"TS Optics 1.25"" Barlow Lens X2","<p>This x2 Barlow lens doubles the magnification of your telescope with minimal loss of quality.

<p>There are 2 ways to use this Barlow:<br data-mce-fragment=""1""></p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>(x2 Pow</em>e<em>r) -</em> Just plug the eyepiece into the Barlow and they have a doubling effect of the magnification.</li>
<li>
<em>(x1.5 Power) -</em> Screw the Barlow element directly into the filter thread of your 1.25"" eyepiece and the extension factor will be shortened to x1.5.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to the integrated T2 thread, you can also screw the Barlow directly onto a T2 ring. The extension factor here is about x2.5. With the Barlow you can also connect your DSLR camera to smaller entry-level telescopes and focus it without any problems.</p>
<p>The Barlow shifts the focus further outwards, so in the case of entry-level Newtonian telescopes with 76 mm, 114 mm or 130 mm aperture, the Barlow is often the only way to photograph with a DSLR camera. Of course, it works well with all other telescopes also.</p>

One solution is to purchase a Mono camera but this can be expensive and might also require the purchase of several types of narrowband filters and a filter wheel.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">L-Pro is a multi-bandpass filter which offers much better color balance by maximizing the transmission band. The balanced transmission allows astrophotos to be taken with minimal color cast to broadband emission objects such as galaxies, reflection nebulae and globular star clusters. L-Pro remains the best choice for viewing or photographing broadband targets in light polluted areas.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">L-Pro (L-Professional) filter is designed to improve the visibility of various deepsky objects by selectively reducing the transmission of wavelengths of light pollutants, specifically those produced by artificial lights such as mercury vapor lamps, both high &amp; low pressure sodium vapor lights and the unwanted natural light caused by neutral oxygen emission in our atmosphere (i.e. skyglow). Together with the highly transparent main emission lines at OIII (496nm and 500nm), H-beta (486nm), NII (654nm and 658nm), H-alpha (656nm) as well as SII (672nm), the filter is suitable for enhancing the contrast and details for both visual and photograghic purpose at sub-rural areas with heavy light pollution.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">L-Pro has a multiple anti-reflective coating on the optical substrate and uses a precision coating based on ion deposition coating technology.

Together with the highly transparent main emission lines at OIII (496nm and 500nm), H-beta (486nm), NII (654nm and 658nm), H-alpha (656nm) as well as SII (672nm), the filter is suitable for enhancing the contrast and details for both visual and photograghic purpose at sub-rural areas with heavy light pollution.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">L-Pro has a multiple anti-reflective coating on the optical substrate and uses a precision coating based on ion deposition coating technology.

SK0000241-UK,Telescope Dew Shields - (Various sizes),"<p>Glass surfaces such as telescope lenses pointing to the clear sky are prone to having dew forming on the lens during the night - especially if its humid. They also tend to capture stray light, which reduces the contrast of the target.</p>
<p>As many astronomers and astrophotographers have experienced, on clear nights, dew is often a real problem and if it forms on your lens it can render your nights observing session over. After only a very short time, the optics can start fogging, making viewing or photography impossible. A good dew shield reduces the risk of fogging and extends the observing time. <em>Note</em>: on extremely humid nights, dew heaters will also be required. Dew shields are not required for Newtonian reflectors.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Lateral stray light from street lights can also enter the lens which reduces contrast and often cause unwanted reflections in photographs. These dew shields are also blackened out inside with non reflective felt, to help prevent stray light from entering the telescope.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""></p>
<ul>
<li>These dew shields are available in various diameters</li>
<li>The velcro fasteners are sewn and cannot detach. The dew shields themselves are made from weather-proof and non-ageing plastic.</li>
<li>These dew shields are extra flexible, the retentive area for the Velcro is much broader than the from many other designs. This offers a larger retentive area and also a better adaption to the diameter of your telescope.</li>
<li>Once attached to the tube, they hold very well. The contact surfaces to the tube are coated with a non-slip foam rubber.</li>
<li>They can be combined with dew heaters on extremely humid nights.</li>

SK0000242-UK,Celestron StarSense AutoAlign Module,"<p><strong>The fastest and easiest way to get started with the fascinating hobby of astronomy.</strong></p>
<p>Simply enter the observation location and local time once in the evening, and you won't have to do anything else for the rest of the night. The StarSense camera eye takes three pictures of the sky after the telescope is switched on. This takes about three minutes. After that, the device knows where in the sky which stars, planets, galaxies, and gas nebulae are located and shows them to you at the touch of a button! It even suggests the most beautiful objects in the sky. You really don't need any prior experience to become an amateur astronomer on your first night with this fantastic new technology. In fact, 40,000 celestial objects are stored in its database!</p>
<p>Even experienced amateur astronomers will appreciate the affordable StarSense module. StarSense replaces expensive software and enables excellent horizon-to-horizon positioning accuracy thanks to any number of calibration stars. And of course, you can use the short time the telescope automatically completes the alignment procedure to prepare for the night.</p>
<p>StarSense for Celestron is compatible with all current computerized Celestron telescopes, as well as many of the older models too.</p>
<p><strong>StarSense on Azimuthal telescopes:</strong><br>The StarSense module can fully demonstrate its capabilities on alt-azimuth telescopes – including motorized Dobsonians. No north alignment is required, you simply need to set up the device under a clear, dark sky with an unobstructed view of the surrounding sky. At least three-quarters of the sky should allow a clear view of the starry sky. Then simply enter the date, time, and location as usual. For devices with built-in GPS or the optional SkySync GPS receiver, this is unnecessary as the GPS module will detect this information automatically.</p>
<p>The StarSense camera then scans the sky, and after about three minutes, it has enough data to create a model of the sky. Then all you have to do is select the objects you want to observe from the handheld controller's extensive database. If you were caught off guard by good weather and didn't have time to prepare for the night of observation, that's no problem either as The TOUR function suggests the most beautiful objects currently visible in the night sky at your present location.</p>
<p><strong>StarSense on Equatorial telescopes:</strong><br>The StarSense module can also be used on equatorially mounted telescopes (such as the Celestron Advanced VX, CGEM, CGEM DX, CGE Pro, or even certain SkyWatcher SynScan mounts such as the EQ6, EQ8, AZ-EQ5, and AZ-EQ6).</p>
<p>However, if you're using the mount while on the move, you'll still need to align it north – after all, the tracking axis must be parallel to the Earth's axis. The StarSense module can help with this too: If you've only roughly aligned the mount north (i.e., you've placed the telescope in its starting position and can see Polaris in the finderscope) and switch on the StarSense module, the telescope will search for the reference stars. If you use more than two reference stars, you can increase the GOTO accuracy for visual use. </p>
<p>You can then call up the All Star Polar Alignment, familiar and proven from the Celestron NexStar controller, to align the mount to another reference star. Since you have to turn the mount's adjustment screws for this, the StarsSense module can only help here. But you save yourself the tedious task of haveing to kneel under the polar finder scope and can still set up the mount accurately enough for photography – conveniently and easily. </p>
<p>The StarSense module then carries out the subsequent re-alignment independently.</p>

SK0000247-UK,4 Port Dew Heater Controller,"The Astrozap dual-channel controller uses pulse-width modulation technology. Each channel controls two outputs of a total of four outputs. Each channel is able to maintain a duty cycle of 5% at low setting to 95% at high setting. The Astrozap dew regulator is designed to operate at 12 volts DC and should never be operated at any other voltage. The total current capacity for all four outputs is 5 amps - We recommend using Astrozap Heater bands however other brands can be used once they are a similar rating.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The controller is supplied with a cable about 1.8 meters long, which is equipped with a cigarette lighter plug. A 5-amp fuse is integrated in the connector. The red power LED indicates that the controller is being powered and the two red lights on the outputs indicate the power level of each channel. The brighter the red LEDs, the longer the duty cycle for this channel. When it is set to the lowest setting, it is effectively turned off. It also includes a 2-inch Velcro strap for attaching the controller to a suitable area of your telescope mount.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>Specs:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">

SK0000248-UK,Telescope Dew Shield - (Large 314mm),"<p>Glass surfaces such as telescope lenses pointing to the clear sky are prone to having dew forming on the lens during the night - especially if its humid. They also tend to capture stray light, which reduces the contrast of the target.</p>
<p>As many astronomers and astrophotographers have experienced, on clear nights, dew is often a real problem and if it forms on your lens it can render your nights observing session over. After only a very short time, the optics can start fogging, making viewing or photography impossible. A good dew shield reduces the risk of fogging and extends the observing time. <em>Note</em>: on extremely humid nights, dew heaters will also be required. Dew shields are not required for Newtonian reflectors.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Lateral stray light from street lights can also enter the lens which reduces contrast and often cause unwanted reflections in photographs. These dew shields are also blackened out inside with non reflective felt, to help prevent stray light from entering the telescope.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""></p>
<ul>
<li>Dew shield for larger OTA's (314mm)<br>
</li>
<li>The velcro fasteners are sewn and cannot detach. The dew shields themselves are made from weather-proof and non-ageing plastic.</li>
<li>These dew shields are extra flexible, the retentive area for the Velcro is much broader than the from many other designs. This offers a larger retentive area and also a better adaption to the diameter of your telescope.</li>
<li>Once attached to the tube, they hold very well. The contact surfaces to the tube are coated with a non-slip foam rubber.</li>
<li>They can be combined with dew heaters on extremely humid nights.</li>

SK0000249-UK,ZWO ASI 294MC Pro - Colour,"<div>
<div><strong>ASI cameras are renowned for excellent features and superior image quality with modern CMOS sensors installed. The ASI294MC-P camera uses the state-of-the-art ""back-illuminated"" Sony IMX294CJK sensor.<br><br></strong></div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Sony specifies a sensor diagonal of 21.63 mm. However, measurements by ZWO have shown a true diagonal of 23.2 mm. The 4.3 µm pixels of the ZWO ASI294MC make this camera an all-rounder with highest sensitivity for short exposure times.<br><br><em>Advantages and features of the ASI MC294MCPro color camera:</em><br>
<ul>
<li>USB 3.0 for a fast download - can also be used with USB 2.0</li>
<li>DDR3 memory buffer to help improve data transfer reliability. Additionally, the use of a memory buffer minimizes amp-glow, which is caused by the slow transfer speeds when the camera is used with a USB 2.0 port.</li>
<li>Powerful Peltier cooling up to 45 °C below environment.</li>
<li>Powerful Peltier cooling up to 35 °C below ambient</li>
<li>Sensitive CMOS sensor with 23.2 mm diagonal - 11.7 megapixels</li>
<li>Good resolution through 4.63 µm pixels</li>
<li>Comes with AR protection window - full transmission also in IR. If infrared should be blocked, an IR-cut filter is necessary.</li>
<li>Distance from T2 connection thread (female) to camera sensor: 17.5 mm</li>
<li>Very high sensitivity - QE more than 75% - ideal astronomy camera for dim objects</li>
<li>14bit ADC</li>
<li>HCG mode - if gain is higher than 120 (12 dB), read noise is reduced below 2e- - result: low-noise images despite extremely high sensitivity.</li>
<li>Full well capacity 63700e - even bright stars do not burn out anymore, you get a better signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
</ul>
ASI294MC Pro has the same mechanics as ASI1600 Pro. There are four screws that seal the sensor chamber and the camera design has been extensively tested and is very stable. Even when used in higher humidity environments, ASI294MC Pro will still work well without dew problems.<br><br><em>USB 3.0 Port &amp; USB2.0 HUB:</em><br>
<ol>
<li>USB 3.0 Port: Provide 5Gb bandwidth to make it possible for ASI294 Pro to run at 16 fps (14bit, normal mode) or 19 fps (12bit, high speed mode) at full resolution(11.7Mega).</li>
<li>USB 2.0 HUB: can connect with various accessories, such as filter wheel, guide camera and electronic focuser, so you can better manage your cables. The ASI294 Pro includes two short 0.5m USB 2.0 cables. The integrated USB 2.0 hub is powered by the external power source if you connect one.</li>

SK0000251-UK,ZWO ASI 2600MC Pro - Colour,"<ul></ul>
<p><strong>The ASI 2600 MC Pro is a powerful color astro camera using the color sensor in APS-C format with an extremely high sensitivity and 16 bit data depth. This means that even with longer exposure times, the stars no longer burn out and you get a much better dynamic range in your images.</strong><br><br>One of the outstanding features of the ASI 2600MC Pro however is the sensational light sensitivity and the QE of 80%. Thanks to the back illumination technology and the very low amplifier glow, this camera is very well suited for all astronomical applications - Particularly for deep sky astrophotography.<br><br>The camera has a 26MP sensor with a small pixel size of 3.76um, yet it accommodates an impressively large well depth of 50 ke-. As one of the few CMOS astronomy cameras with 16-bit ADC on the market, ASI2600MC Pro was developed with the optimal characteristics for astrophotography in mind. This 16bit ADC is not a CCD 16bit ADC, it can really achieve a dynamic range output of 14 stop, which will significantly improve the image sharpness and contrast, and also create smoother and more natural colour transitions.<br><br>The ASI2600MC Pro also comes with the polyamide heating element that can avoid any condensation problems on the camera sensor. The anti-dew heater, heats up the protective screen slightly to avoid condensation problems. The power of the anti-dew heater is about 5W. It can be switched on and off in the software to save electricity.<br><br><strong>Camera Spec:</strong><br></p>

SK0000252-UK,ZWO ASI 533MC Pro - Colour,"<div><strong>The ASI533MC Pro is a powerful color astro camera using the latest generation sensor technology. The color sensor with a diagonal of approx. 16 mm can be used on almost any telescope.</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Due to the square shape, the corrected image field of the telescope is optimally used which even allows many telescopes without a corrector to be used. One of the outstanding features of the ASI 533MC Pro however is the sensational light sensitivity and the QE of 80%. Thanks to the back illumination technology and the very low amplifier glow, this camera is very well suited for all astronomical applications - Particularly for deep sky astrophotography.<br><br><strong>Main features at a glance:</strong><br>
<ol>
<li>USB 3.0 for a quick download - can also be operated with USB 2.0 - DDR3 memory buffer for stable data transfer with USB2.0 - this minimizes amplifier glow.</li>
<li>Powerful Peltier cooling up to -35 °C below ambient.</li>
<li>One of Sony's most light-sensitive CMOS sensors</li>
<li>High resolution through 3.76 μm pixels - ideal for fast and sharp telescopes, such as APO's, Hyperstar, Celestron Faststar, fast Newtonian telescopes.</li>
<li>Includes AR clear glass filter - full passage even in infrared. If the IR is to be blocked, an IR cut filter is required.</li>
<li>Distance T2 connection thread (female thread) to the camera sensor: 17.5 mm</li>
<li>Distance front surface to sensor (when using the male thread): only 6.5 mm.</li>
<li>High sensitivity - QE over 80 % - ideal astronomy camera for faint objects</li>
<li>14-bit ADC - this allows you to achieve a depth similar to CCD cameras, but with much higher sensitivity</li>
</ol>
<strong>Areas of Application:</strong><br><em>Deep sky images</em> (nebulae and galaxies): Due to the high sensitivity, nebulae and galaxies are imaged after just a few seconds and the camera can be cooled down to -35 °C below ambient conditions which further reduces the already low noise level. By up-regulating the GAIN (comparable to the ISO setting for digital DSLR cameras), you can reduce the exposure times to less than 30 seconds - This helps to reduce the problems associated with seeing conditions and tracking errors.<br><em><br>For the Moon and Planetary images</em>, extremely short exposure times are also possible due to camera's high sensitivity. Due to the high resolution of the sensor, many details can be imaged a shorter focal length - Video capture is also possible.<br><br><em>Important: external power supply required:</em><br>This camera requires 1 amp minimum (even during uncooled operation), which is a problem for USB sockets on computers, because they are only designed for 900 mA, i.e. 0.9 Amps, therefore a 12V power supply is required to use this camera (sold separately).<br><br><strong>Camera Spec:</strong><br>

SK0000253-UK,Explore Scientific Deep Sky 7.1MP Astro Camera - Colour,"<p><strong>This high resolution deep sky camera incorporates a large 'Sony Exmor IMX428 CMOS' sensor and active cooling and is ideal for telescopes with short and moderate focal lengths.</strong><br><br>The Explore Scientific 7.1MP Astro camera comes in a modern complete package for the comfortable imaging of a wide range of night sky targets. This easy-to-use camera is ideal for capturing galaxies, star clusters, the moon and even planets with an extremely high sensor sensitivity and very low sensor noise. The high sensitivity enables very short exposure times and the freezing of the air turbulence (seeing) in planetary images. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred to your storage device within seconds.<br><br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope using the T2 female thread (M42.0.75mm) or the supplied 2"" (50.8mm) plug-in adapter and after installing the drivers and the included Explore Capture recording and editing software, you are ready to start imaging.<br><br>The Explore Capture pro software included, not only offers the basic functions required for imaging and video capture, but also many helpful special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Functions such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, time lapse recording and much more can be configured individually. This sophisticated software makes your entry into astrophotography much easier and using the automatic default settings you can produce stunning results without any previous knowledge.<br><br>The Explore Scientific deep sky camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise Sony Exmor IMX428 CMOS sensor which is additionally cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. In contrast to normal DSLR cameras, this guarantees much lower noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots. The images are not only much sharper and more detailed, but also contain more usable signal information. As this camera is cooled, you can carry out your dark and bias frame calibrations at any time. The large-format CMOS sensor with 17.6mm diagonal also allows large image fields and makes framing objects so much easier. <br><br>The camera has a built-in USB hub with 2 x USB2.0 ports at the rear. Connect your additional auto guider camera or motor focus etc. via a short USB cable and reduce the risk of cable spaghetti and cable breaks. Separate cable connections between your accessories and your computer are no longer necessary. To protect the camera when not in use, a sturdy hard case is also included. <br><em><br></em> <strong>Key Camera Features:</strong><br></p>

</div>
<ul></ul>
<p><strong>The ASI 2600 MM Pro is a powerful mono astro camera using with a sensor using APS-C format with an extremely high sensitivity and 16 bit data depth. This means that even with longer exposure times, the stars no longer burn out and you get a much better dynamic range in your images.</strong></p>
<div>One of the outstanding features of the ASI 2600MM Pro however is the sensational light sensitivity and the QE of 91%. Thanks to the back illumination technology and the very low amplifier glow, this camera is very well suited for all astronomical applications - Particularly for deep sky astrophotography.<br><br>The camera has a 26MP sensor with a small pixel size of 3.76um, yet it accommodates an impressively large well depth of 50 ke-. As one of the few CMOS astronomy cameras with 16-bit ADC on the market, ASI2600MM Pro was developed with the optimal characteristics for astrophotography in mind. This 16bit ADC is not a CCD 16bit ADC, it can really achieve a dynamic range output of 14 stop, which will significantly improve the image sharpness and contrast, and also create smoother and more natural colour transitions.<br><br>The ASI2600MM Pro also comes with the polyamide heating element that can avoid any condensation problems on the camera sensor. The anti-dew heater, heats up the protective screen slightly to avoid condensation problems. The power of the anti-dew heater is about 5 W. It can be switched on and off in the software to save electricity.<br>

SK0000255-UK,ZWO ASI 6200MC Pro - Colour,"<div>
<div>
<strong>The ZWO ASI6200MC Pro is a full-frame OSC Astrocamera with extremely high light sensitivity. The camera can be used on all well-corrected telescopes and is a real lightweight at only 700 grams.</strong><br><br><em>Full-frame and high resolution:</em><br>The Sony IMX455 sensor offers true full-frame with 24x36 mm dimensions and a diagonal of 43.3 mm. With 3.76 μm pixels, even fine details, such as in galaxy arms, can be resolved. A gigantic field and a high resolution - that's what the 62 MP sensor offers.<br><br><em>Back Illumination Technology:</em><br>Sony's rear-exposed CMOS image sensor improves sensitivity and noise reduction – the key factors in improving image quality, while radically realigned the basic pixel structure from front to back exposure. The advantages of CMOS image sensors, such as low power consumption and high operating speed, have been retained.<br><br>Backside exposure improves light capture while increasing the amount of light. This makes significantly shorter exposure times possible and leads to improved quantum efficiency of up to 91%. Sony has developed a unique photodiode structure and an on-chip lens optimized for rear-exposed structures, resulting in higher sensitivity and lower random noise without light by reducing noise, dark current and defective pixels compared to the traditional front-exposed<br>structure.<br><br><em>No amplifier glow:</em><br>Conventional CMOS sensors produce a weak infrared light source during operation, which is often seen in the corners of uncalibrated images as signs of the ""glow of the amplifier"". Since the ASI6200MC Pro uses a zero-amp glow circuit, you don't have to worry about the amp glow or amplifier glow even when using highly amplified, long-exposed images.<br><br><em>Built-in anti-dew heater:</em><br>
<ul>
<li>The ASI6200 Pro comes with the polyimide heating element, which can avoid any condensation problems.</li>
<li>The anti-dew heater, which fits completely on the protective screen, heats it up a bit to avoid condensation problems.</li>
<li>The power of the anti-dew heater is about 5 W. It can be switched on and off in the software to save electricity.</li>
</ul>
<em>Important: external power supply required:</em><br>This camera requires 1 amp minimum (even during uncooled operation), which is a problem for USB sockets on computers, because they are only designed for 900 mA, i.e. 0.9 Amps, therefore a 12V power supply is required to use this camera (sold separately).<br><br><strong>Camera Spec:</strong><br>

SK0000259-UK,ZWO ASI 533MM Pro - Mono,"<div>
<strong>ZWO ASI533MM Pro - powerful mono astro camera with the latest generation sensor. </strong><strong>This monochrome sensor with a diagonal of approx. 16 mm can be used on almost every telescope. Due to the square shape, it even allows the use of many larger telescopes without a corrector.</strong><br><br>A special feature of the ASI533MM Pro is the zero-amp glow circuit, which eliminates the amplifier glow that occurs with longer exposure times. This would brighten areas of the image at longer exposure times, particularly around the corners. The electronics are also designed to reduce the effect of external stray light, so you can take longer exposures under light-polluted skies.<br><br>One of the outstanding features of the ASI 533MM Pro is its sensational light sensitivity. The QE of 80% thanks to back illumination technology along with the very low amplifier glow make this camera very suitable for all astronomical applications, but especially for deep-sky astrophotography.<br><br><strong>Advantages and features of the ASI 533MM Pro camera:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>USB 3.0 for fast download - can also be used with USB 2.0</li>
<li>DDR3 memory buffer for stable data transfer with USB2.0 - This minimizes amplifier glow</li>
<li>Powerful Peltier cooling up to 35°C below ambient conditions</li>
<li>One of Sony´s most light-sensitive CMOS sensors</li>
<li>High resolution by 3.76 µm pixels - ideal for fast and sharp telescopes like APO's, Hyperstar, Celestron Faststar, Newtonian telescopes etc.</li>
<li>Supplied with AR clear glass filter - full transmission also in infrared. If the IR is to be blocked, an IR cut filter is required.</li>
<li>Distance T2 connection thread (female thread) to camera sensor: 17.5 mm</li>
<li>Distance front surface to sensor (using male thread): only 6.5 mm</li>
<li>High sensitivity - QE over 80% - ideal astronomy camera for low-light objects</li>
<li>14-bit ADC. Similar depth to CCD cameras, but with a much higher sensitivity.</li>
</ul>
<em>Application areas of the camera:</em><br><br><strong>Deep-sky images (nebulae and galaxies):</strong> <br>Due to the high sensitivity, nebulae and galaxies are imaged after only a few seconds. The camera can be cooled up to 35°C below ambient temperature. By raising the Gain level (comparable to the ISO setting for digital SLR cameras), you can reduce exposure times to less than 30 seconds. Effects caused by air turbulence or inaccuracies in tracking are therefore dramatically reduced.<br><br><strong>Lunar and planetary images:</strong> <br>Extremely short exposure times due to high sensitivity freeze the air turbulence. Due to the high resolution of the sensor, many details can be imaged even with a shorter telescope focal length. Video 'Lucky Imaging' astrophotography is also possible.<br><br><strong>Back illumination technology:</strong><br>Sony's back-illuminated CMOS image sensor improves sensitivity and noise reduction, which are the key factors to enhancing image quality. This retains the advantages of traditional CMOS image sensors such as low power consumption and high-speed operation.<br><br>This allows significantly shorter exposure times and leads to an improved quantum efficiency of 80%.<br><br><strong>Zero amp glow:</strong><br>Traditional CMOS sensors produce a weak infrared light source during operation quite often seen in the corner of uncalibrated images as the tell tale signs of 'amp glow'. As the ASI533MM Pro uses zero amp glow circuitry, you won't have to worry about amp glow even when using high gain, long exposure imaging.<br><br><em>Important: external power supply required!</em><br>Please notice that all ZWO cameras with a cooler need to be connected to an external 11-15 V power supply to work. Even when the cooler is not being used the power supply must be used for the camera to operate.<br><br>Good storage is an important factor in the prevention against dew and also extends the life span of the camera. Always ensure your camera is stored in a cool dry place and any excess moisture from dew or frost is removed.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong>

The extremely high sensitivity is achieved thanks to the SONY back illumination technology. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred within seconds, reducing the need for high buffering or delay times.<br><br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope via female T2 thread (M42, 0.75mm) or via the supplied 2"" (50.8 mm) plug-in adapter and then install the drivers as required and you're ready to go.<br><br>The included EXPLORE Capture professional software not only offers the necessary basic functions for image and video recording, but also includes many special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Features such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, timelapse shooting and much more can be individually configured.<br><br>This Explore Scientific Deep Sky Astro camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise SONY EXMOR IMX-571 APS-C CMOS sensor, which can be additionally cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. This guarantees far less noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots compared to normal DSLR cameras. As a result, your images are not only much sharper and detailed, but simply containmore usable image information for post processing. Due to the controlled setting of the desired camera temperature, <br>dark frames can be created at any time after the imaging session. The large-format CMOS sensor with a diagonal of 28.3mm also allows a wider image FOV and greatly simplifies the setting and centering of objects.<br><br>The backlit EXMOR CMOS sensor increases quantum efficiency up to 80% at 533nm, which means an extremely high luminous efficiancy and therefore particularly bright and high-contrast photos.<br><br>The camera also has a built-in USB hub on the back with 2 x USB 2.0 ports. This allows you to Connect additional accessories such as an autoguider camera or auto-focusser etc. via short USB cable and thus reduce the risk of Cable clutter and cable breaks.<br><br>A sturdy hard case is also included for the camera.<br><br><em>Field of view for different focal lengths in arc minutes and degrees:</em><br>

SK0000262-UK,ZWO ASI 662MC - Colour,"<p><strong>The ZWO ASI662MC is a color USB 3.0 Astro Camera with passive Air-Cooling. </strong></p>
<p>This astro camera is equipped with a modern 1/2.8"" sensor with 1920*1080 pixels and provides an extremely smooth image without amplifier glow thanks to the modern Starvis-2 technology (back-illumination), making it ideal for the following applications:<br></p>
<ol>
<li>Detailed planetary and Lunar photography (as well as Solar photography with a suitable solar filter).</li>
<li>Photography of (small) brighter nebulae and star clusters with a max exposure time up to 2000 seconds.</li>
<li>Infrared photography to reduce the influence of seeing, thus sharper luminance channel</li>
<li>Autoguiding camera (autoguiding port is available)</li>
<li>EAA (electronically assisted astronomy) for planets, moon and sun</li>
</ol>
<strong>Lunar and planetary photography:</strong><br>Due to the fine 2.9 μm pixels, you achieve a very high resolution already from f/10, which makes the use of Barlow lenses and converter systems less necessary.<br><br><strong>EAA (electronically assisted astronomy):</strong><br>The high resolution, combined with a high frame rate of 108 fps at full resolution (RAW8 format), allows real-time observation of planets as well as details on the moon and sun. This makes it possible to observe together in a group on a computer screen for example.<br><br><strong>Use as autoguider:</strong><br>The ASI662MC is a lightweight with only 126 grams and offers the ST-4 autoguiding interface. A 2 meter long autoguiding cable is also included.<br><br><strong>AR-coated clear glass filter protects the sensor from dust:</strong><br>The clear glass filter prevents dust from getting to the sensor. It also lets UV and infrared through, so you can also do infrared photography with the camera. You have full control over what light hits the sensor with the right choice of contrast filters, nebula filters, IR pass filters, or UV/IR blocking filters.<br><br><strong>Air cooling - reduces sensor temperature:</strong><br>The sensor heats up during the exposures. The PCS dissipates heat from the sensor via a heat conducting pad. The sensor temperature is thus reduced by up to 15 degrees Celsius compared to cameras without PCS.<br><br><strong>Very high sensitivity for short exposure times:</strong><br>One advantage of the back-illuminated CMOS sensor is the lower readout noise and improved sensitivity. In particular, Sony uses STARVIS-2 technology in the IMX662 sensor, which provides excellent low-light visibility. You can achieve a very high light output in astro imaging and realize high image quality not only in visible light, but also in the near infrared range (to reduce seeing). In addition, the low readout noise and the high full-well capacity ensure a higher dynamic range.<br><br>The ASI662MC is not only ideal for Planetary and Lunar imaging, but can also be used as a live streaming camera or as an all-sky camera for observing or monitoring weather conditions.<br><br><strong>The HCG mode:</strong><br>The camera has a built-in HCG mode that can effectively reduce readout noise at high gain and maintain the same wide dynamic range that you would expect at low gain. When the gain is 150, the HCG mode will turn on automatically. This results in readout noise below 1.45 e- while the dynamic range can still reach almost 12.5 f-stops.<br><br><strong>Camera Specification:</strong><br>

SK0000263-UK,ZWO ASI 2600MC DUO - Colour,"<ul></ul>
<p><strong>The ASI2600MC Duo combines imaging and guiding sensors in one compact body. The main sensor is the Sony IMX571 sensor with a native 16-bit ADC, 14 stops dynamic range and 3.76 µm square pixels. The readout noise is as low as 1.0e and the full well capacity reaches an incredible level of 73ke. And on top of all this it has no amp glow!</strong></p>
<p>The guide sensor is the type 1/1.8 SC2210 with excellent NIR sensitivity. The sensor size is 7.68mm x 4.32mm. It has 4µm x 4µm pixels with an array of 1920 × 1080 and a full depth of 8780e. The stars on the corner of the guide images affected by reducers back focus distance might not appear very round however this is not due to the sensor tilt and it will not affect normal use.</p>
<p><strong>Two-in-one design:</strong><br>Thanks to the compact design, the ASI2600MC Duo only needs one USB cable for control. It reduces potential cabling issues and improves setup speeds. You don´t need a separate OAG and guiding camera.</p>
<p><em>The main sensor:</em><br>The main sensor which is the IMX571 features an APS-C format &amp; 26MP total pixels. The size of the sensor is 23.5mm in width x 15.7mm in height, and the diagonal is 28.3mm. The 3.76µm x 3.76µm small pixel size accommodates an impressive full depth of 50ke and with the new hardware technology, it can even be extended to 73ke.</p>
<p><em>Guide sensor:</em><br>The SC2210 sensor was taken from the ASI220MM Mini camera and features very high sensitivity. The QE peak value reaches 92% at 500nm and the readout noise is as low as 0.6e. As this is a new generation of guide sensor, it has achieved great results in guiding, proven by hundreds of astrophotographers worldwide.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 cable operates both sensors (Main and Guide sensor). The guide sensor can then be selected in PHD2, for example, and the IMX571 sensor in the imaging software that you are using.</p>
<p><strong>Special Features:</strong></p>
<p><em>STARVIS technology:</em><br>ASI2600MC DUO is based on Sony's STARVIS technology. Sony's back-illuminated CMOS image sensor improves sensitivity and noise reduction - the key factors to enhancing image quality.</p>
<p><em>Native 16bit ADC:</em><br>This 16-bit ADC is not a CCD 16-bit ADC. It can really achieve a dynamic range output of 14 stops, which will significantly improve the image sharpness and contrast, and also create smoother and more natural color transitions.</p>
<p><em>FPS:</em><br>ASI2600MC Duo's max FPS in RAW 8 mode at full resolution is 15 fps, which is even quicker compared to ASI2600MC Pro.</p>
<p><em>Extended full well mode:</em><br>The full well capacity of ASI2600MC Duo is extended to 73ke, which is x1.46 more than ASI2600MC Pro.</p>
<p><em>USB 3.0 &amp; 512 MB DDR3 buffer:</em><br>With the use of the USB 3.0 cable and 512MB DDR3 buffer, ASI2600MC Duo provides a stable and secure data transmission that can effectively avoid frame-dropping issues during long exposures.</p>
<p><em>No amp-glow:</em><br>Traditional CMOS sensors produce a weak infrared light source during operation quite often seen in the corner of uncalibrated images. This is the tell-tale sign of amp glow. As the ASI2600MC Duo uses zero-amp glow circuitry so you won´t have to worry about amp glow even when using high gain, long exposure imaging.</p>
<p><em>QE (Quantum efficiency):</em><br>Based on ZWO's testing results, the QE peak value of ASI2600MC Duo is over 91%.</p>
<p><em>Two-stage TEC cooling:</em><br>Thanks to the two-stage TEC cooling, ASI2600MC Duo can lower the CMOS sensor temperature to more than 35 degrees Celsius below ambient temperature, which can greatly reduce dark current generation and sensor noise even during extended exposure times.</p>
<p><em>* The Delta T35 °C is tested at 30°C ambient temperature. It might reduce downwards when the cooling system is working for a long time. Also, as the ambient temperature falls, the Delta T would also decrease.</em></p>
<p><em>Dark current noise:</em><br>The dark current noise of the ASI2600MC Duo is extremely low. Even with moderate cooling, you get a very low-noise image.</p>
<p><em>Anti-Dew heater:</em><br>There is a polyimide heater completely fitting the protective window in the ASI2600MC Duo camera. It can help avoid any potential annoying dew or icing issues depending on the environment in which you capture images. The power of the heater is around 5W. You are free to turn it off anytime in your photography software if you want to save power.</p>
<p><strong>Important: external power supply required!</strong><br>This camera requires a 1 amp power supply even during uncooled operation, which can be a problem for USB ports on computers, because they are generally only rated for 900 mA (0.9 A). Stable operation of the camera is therefore only possible with an external 12V power supply.</p>
<p><em>Practical Storage advice: </em><br>Storage of cameras and accessories, especially in our latitudes, the nights are often very humid. This humidity condenses on your camera, eyepiece or filter when they come into the warm interior of your home after imaging. Cooled cameras are especially affected by this. Good storage is an important prevention mechanism against dew and also extends the life span of your equipment.</p>
<p>After use, put the camera immediately into its Protect Case and ideally add some silica gel. During storage, the silica gel will suck the moisture out of the camera. At the same time, the penetration of humid room air is prevented. Dry storage even allows the small dry tablets in cooled cameras to partially regenerate. Your camera or accessories are always ready for you in optimal condition. Silica Gel is available here:</p>
<p>The cameras are not airtight, so if the camera remains on the telescope, it is exposed to moisture. The small amount of desiccant in the camera can protect the sensor and the inside of the protective glass from moisture for the duration of the exposure, but not for days on end. Moisture problems can be the result. A simple trick is to stretch a plastic bag around the focuser to which the camera is attached so that no air can get in. Silica gel is placed in a small cloth bag inside the plastic bag. This will also create a ""dry climate zone"" for the camera on the telescope. This allows you to leave the camera on the telescope for a few days for an imaging session lasting several days.</p>
<p><strong>Guiding without ST-4 Port:</strong><br>This camera has no ST-4 autoguider port, so you have to connect the mount directly to the PC.</p>

SK0000264-UK,ZWO ASI 2600MM DUO - Mono,"<ul></ul>
<p><strong>The ASI2600MM Duo combines imaging and guiding sensors in one compact body. The main sensor is the Sony IMX571 sensor with a native 16-bit ADC, 14 stops dynamic range and 3.76 µm square pixels. The readout noise is as low as 1.0e and the full well capacity reaches an incredible level of 73ke. And on top of all this it has no amp glow!</strong></p>
<p>The guide sensor is the type 1/1.8 SC2210 with excellent NIR sensitivity. The sensor size is 7.68mm x 4.32mm. It has 4µm x 4µm pixels with an array of 1920 × 1080 and a full depth of 8780e. The stars on the corner of the guide images affected by reducers back focus distance might not appear very round however this is not due to the sensor tilt and it will not affect normal use.</p>
<p><strong>Two-in-one design:</strong><br>Thanks to the compact design, the ASI2600MM Duo only needs one USB cable for control. It reduces potential cabling issues and improves setup speeds. You don´t need a separate OAG and guiding camera.</p>
<p><em>The main sensor:</em><br>The main sensor which is the IMX571 features an APS-C format &amp; 26MP total pixels. The size of the sensor is 23.5mm in width x 15.7mm in height, and the diagonal is 28.3mm. The 3.76µm x 3.76µm small pixel size accommodates an impressive full depth of 50ke and with the new hardware technology, it can even be extended to 73ke.</p>
<p><em>Guide sensor:</em><br>The SC2210 sensor was taken from the ASI220MM Mini camera and features very high sensitivity. The QE peak value reaches 92% at 500nm and the readout noise is as low as 0.6e. As this is a new generation of guide sensor, it has achieved great results in guiding, proven by hundreds of astrophotographers worldwide.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 cable operates both sensors (Main and Guide sensor). The guide sensor can then be selected in PHD2, for example, and the IMX571 sensor in the imaging software that you are using.</p>
<p><strong>Special Features:</strong></p>
<p><em>STARVIS technology:</em><br>ASI2600MM DUO is based on Sony's STARVIS technology. Sony's back-illuminated CMOS image sensor improves sensitivity and noise reduction - the key factors to enhancing image quality.</p>
<p><em>Native 16bit ADC:</em><br>This 16-bit ADC is not a CCD 16-bit ADC. It can really achieve a dynamic range output of 14 stops, which will significantly improve the image sharpness and contrast, and also create smoother and more natural color transitions.</p>
<p><em>FPS:</em><br>ASI2600MM Duo's max FPS in RAW 8 mode at full resolution is 15 fps.</p>
<p><em>Extended full well mode:</em><br>The full well capacity of ASI2600MM Duo is extended to 73ke.</p>
<p><em>USB 3.0 &amp; 512 MB DDR3 buffer:</em><br>With the use of the USB 3.0 cable and 512MB DDR3 buffer, ASI2600MM Duo provides a stable and secure data transmission that can effectively avoid frame-dropping issues during long exposures.</p>
<p><em>No amp-glow:</em><br>Traditional CMOS sensors produce a weak infrared light source during operation quite often seen in the corner of uncalibrated images. This is the tell-tale sign of amp glow. As the ASI2600MM Duo uses zero-amp glow circuitry so you won´t have to worry about amp glow even when using high gain, long exposure imaging.</p>
<p><em>QE (Quantum efficiency):</em><br>Based on ZWO's testing results, the QE peak value of ASI2600MM Duo is over 91%.</p>
<p><em>Two-stage TEC cooling:</em><br>Thanks to the two-stage TEC cooling, ASI2600MM Duo can lower the CMOS sensor temperature to more than 35 degrees Celsius below ambient temperature, which can greatly reduce dark current generation and sensor noise even during extended exposure times.</p>
<p><em>* The Delta T35 °C is tested at 30°C ambient temperature. It might reduce downwards when the cooling system is working for a long time. Also, as the ambient temperature falls, the Delta T would also decrease.</em></p>
<p><em>Dark current noise:</em><br>The dark current noise of the ASI2600MM Duo is extremely low. Even with moderate cooling, you get a very low-noise image.</p>
<p><em>Anti-Dew heater:</em><br>There is a polyimide heater completely fitting the protective window in the ASI2600MM Duo camera. It can help avoid any potential annoying dew or icing issues depending on the environment in which you capture images. The power of the heater is around 5W. You are free to turn it off anytime in your photography software if you want to save power.</p>
<p><strong>Important: external power supply required!</strong><br>This camera requires a 1 amp power supply even during uncooled operation, which can be a problem for USB ports on computers, because they are generally only rated for 900 mA (0.9 A). Stable operation of the camera is therefore only possible with an external 12V power supply.</p>
<p><em>Practical Storage advice: </em><br>Storage of cameras and accessories, especially in our latitudes, the nights are often very humid. This humidity condenses on your camera, eyepiece or filter when they come into the warm interior of your home after imaging. Cooled cameras are especially affected by this. Good storage is an important prevention mechanism against dew and also extends the life span of your equipment.</p>
<p>After use, put the camera immediately into its Protect Case and ideally add some silica gel. During storage, the silica gel will suck the moisture out of the camera. At the same time, the penetration of humid room air is prevented. Dry storage even allows the small dry tablets in cooled cameras to partially regenerate. Your camera or accessories are always ready for you in optimal condition. Silica Gel is available here:</p>
<p>The cameras are not airtight, so if the camera remains on the telescope, it is exposed to moisture. The small amount of desiccant in the camera can protect the sensor and the inside of the protective glass from moisture for the duration of the exposure, but not for days on end. Moisture problems can be the result. A simple trick is to stretch a plastic bag around the focuser to which the camera is attached so that no air can get in. Silica gel is placed in a small cloth bag inside the plastic bag. This will also create a ""dry climate zone"" for the camera on the telescope. This allows you to leave the camera on the telescope for a few days for an imaging session lasting several days.</p>
<p><strong>Guiding without ST-4 Port:</strong><br>This camera has no ST-4 autoguider port, so you have to connect the mount directly to the PC.</p>

SK0000265-UK,ZWO ASI 585MC Pro - Colour,"<div>
<p><strong>ZWO ASI585MC Pro color astro camera with active Peltier cooling is a camera for all astrophotographic applications.</strong></p>
<p>This camera is equipped with a 1/1.2"" sensor with 3840x2160 pixels (4K UHD). The modern Sony IMX585 sensor is particularly impressive due to its high resolution (2.9 µm pixels), high frame rate and the complete absence of any amp glow. This makes this camera very interesting not only for planets, the sun and the moon, but also for long exposures (deep-sky photography). The sensor is large enough for many deep-sky objects, yet you can usually manage without a corrector. The ASI585MP Pro is an ideal entry-level camera but also an exciting second camera for dedicated astrophotographers. </p>
<p><em>The camera is very well suited for:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Lunar and planetary photography with high detail resolution<br>
</li>
<li>Solar photography (with suitable filter) with high detail resolution<br>
</li>
<li>Long exposures of nebulae and galaxies<br>
</li>
<li>Infrared photography to reduce the effects of seeing, resulting in a sharper luminance channel<br>
</li>
<li>EAA (electronically assisted astronomy) for planets, moon and sun.</li>
</ul>
<p>This camera is a great alternative to a DSLR and mirrorless camera for deep-sky photography. Even the raw images are of high quality, as the sensor no longer shows any amplifier glow and the images are very smooth and low in noise. Added to this is the powerful Peltier cooling up to 35°C below ambient temperature, which means that low-noise images can be taken even at the height of summer.</p>
<p><em>Moon and planetary photography:</em><br>Thanks to the fine 2.9µm pixels, you can achieve a very high resolution from f/10, which makes the use of Barlow and converter systems superfluous.</p>
<p><em>EAA (electronically assisted astronomy):</em><br>The high resolution, combined with a high frame rate of 47 fps at full resolution (RAW8 format), allows real-time observation not only of planets, but also of the moon and sun due to the relatively large sensor. This means you can observe together in a group - without having to wait until everyone has had a turn!</p>
<p><em>Anti-reflective clear glass filter protects the sensor from dust:</em><br>The clear glass filter prevents dust from penetrating the sensor. It also lets UV and infrared light through so that you can also use the camera for infrared photography. With the right choice of contrast filters, fog filters, IR pass filters or UV/IR blocking filters, you have full control over which light falls on the sensor.</p>
<p><em>Peltier cooling - reduces the sensor temperature:</em><br>The sensor heats up during shooting. Thanks to the controlled Peltier cooling, you can keep the sensor well cooled even at high outside temperatures. At an ambient temperature of 20°C you can cool the sensor down to -15 °C.</p>
<p><em>Very high sensitivity for short exposure times:</em><br>One advantage of the back-illuminated CMOS sensor is the reduced readout noise and improved sensitivity. In particular, Sony uses STARVIS-2 technology with the IMX585 sensor, which ensures excellent visibility in low light. You can achieve a very high light yield in astrophotography and obtain high image quality not only in visible light but also in the near infrared range (to reduce seeing). In addition, the low readout noise and the high full-well capacity ensure a larger dynamic range.</p>
<p>In combination with the large field of view offered by the large sensor format, the ASI585MC is not only ideal for solar, lunar and planetary imaging, but can also be used as a live streaming camera or as an all-sky camera for observing or monitoring weather conditions.</p>
<p>The low noise and anti-amp glow circuit make this Peltier-cooled camera interesting for capturing deep-sky objects such as faint nebulae, star clusters and galaxies.</p>
<p><em>The HCG mode:</em><br>The camera has a built-in HCG mode that can effectively reduce readout noise at high gain while maintaining the same wide dynamic range you would expect at low gain. When the gain is 252, the HCG mode turns on automatically. As a result, the readout noise is only 0.7e-, while the dynamic range can still reach almost 12 f-stops.</p>

<p><strong>ZWO ASI294MM Pro - Cooled Mono CMOS Camera.</strong><br><strong>ASI cameras stand for excellent workmanship and have modern CMOS sensors installed. This versatile camera uses the state-of-the-art ""back-illuminated"" Sony IMX492 sensor.</strong></p>
<p>Sony specifies a sensor diagonal of 21.63mm. However, due to sensor refinement by ZWO the true diagonal is 23.2mm.</p>
<p>The 4.63µm pixels of the ZWO ASI294MM Pro make this camera an all-rounder with highest sensitivity for short exposure times in deep sky photography. Additionally, binning can be switched off, then the pixel size is only 2.32 µm, which increases the detail resolution - even planets can be photographed extremely well this way.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages and features of the ASI MC294MMPro mono camera:</strong><br></p>
<ul>
<li>USB 3.0 for a fast download - can also be used with USB 2.0<br>
</li>
<li>DDR3 memory buffer to help improve data transfer reliability. Additionally, the use of a memory buffer minimizes amp-glow, which is caused by the slow transfer speeds when the camera is used with a USB 2.0 port.<br>
</li>
<li>Powerful Peltier - Cooling up to 35°C below ambient<br>
</li>
<li>Sensitive CMOS sensor with 23.2mm diagonal - 11.7megapixels<br>
</li>
<li>Good resolution through 4.63µm pixels<br>
</li>
<li>Switchable to 2.32µm pixel size and resolution 8288 x 5644<br>
</li>
<li>Comes with AR protection window - full transmission also in IR. If infrared should be blocked, an IR-cut filter is necessary.<br>
</li>
<li>Distance from T2 connection thread (female) to camera sensor: 17.5mm<br>
</li>
<li>Very high sensitivity - QE up to 90% - ideal astronomy camera for dim objects<br>
</li>
<li>14bit ADC<br>
</li>
<li>HCG mode - if gain is higher than 120 (12dB), read noise is reduced below 2e - Result: low-noise images despite extremely high sensitivity.<br>
</li>
<li>Full well capacity 66387e - even bright stars do not burn out anymore, you get a much better signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Application ranges of the camera:</em><br>Deep sky images (nebulae and galaxies): Due to the high sensitivity, nebulae and galaxies are captured after only a few seconds. By cooling down the camera up to 35°C below ambient, the already low noise characteristics can be further reduced. By increasing gain (like the ISO setting of DSLR cameras), you can reduce exposure times to below 30 seconds. Effects from seeing or inaccuracies of the drive are therefore eliminated.<br></p>
<p>Lunar and planetary images: Extremely short exposure times (due to high sensitivity) freeze the seeing. Through the high resolution of the sensor, many details can be reproduced even at shorter focal length. Video astronomy is also possible.</p>
<p><em>Important: external power supply is required!</em><br>Please notice that all ZWO cameras with a cooling system need to be connected to an external 11-15V power supply to work. Even when the cooler is not being used the power supply must be used for the camera to be reliably recognized.</p>
<p>These cameras are not airtight, so if the camera remains on the telescope, it is exposed to moisture. The small amount of desiccant in the camera can protect the sensor and the inside of the protective glass from moisture for the duration of the exposure, but not for days on end. Moisture problems can be the result. A simple trick is to stretch a plastic bag around the focuser to which the camera is attached so that no air can get in. Silica gel is placed in a small cloth bag inside the plastic bag. This will also create a ""dry climate zone"" for the camera on the telescope. This allows you to leave the camera on the telescope for a few days for an imaging session lasting several days.</p>
<p>In the medium and long term, however, this is no substitute for proper storage in an airtight case with silica gel.</p>

SK0000267-UK,ZWO ASI 175MC - Colour,"<p><strong>ZWO ASI715MC USB 3.0 color astro camera with passive air cooling.</strong></p>
<p>This astro camera is equipped with a modern 1/2.8"" sensor with 3864 x 2192 pixels. In addition to the modern Starvis 2 technology (back illumination), the IMX715 offers an extremely smooth image without amplifier glow (amp glow), and has extremely high resolution (1.4µm pixels). This makes the camera particularly suitable for high-resolution photography Such as:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed planetary photography<br>
</li>
<li>Details of the lunar surface<br>
</li>
<li>Sun details (with suitable filter)<br>
</li>
<li>Photography of (small) brighter nebulae and star clusters without power-consuming cooling - exposure times of up to 2000 seconds are possible.<br>
</li>
<li>Infrared images to reduce the influence of seeing, thus sharper luminance channel<br>
</li>
<li>Autoguiding camera (autoguiding connection is available)<br>
</li>
<li>EAA (electronically assisted astronomy) for planets, moon and sun</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EAA (electronically assisted astronomy):</em><br>The high resolution, combined with a high frame rate of 108fps at full resolution (RAW8 format), allows real-time observation of planets as well as details on the moon and sun. Simply observe together in a group - without having to wait until everyone has had a turn!</p>
<p><em>Use as Auto-guider:</em><br>At only 126g, the camera is a very lightweight. It hardly puts any strain on the focuser. The camera of course offers the ST-4 autoguiding interface. A 2 meter long autoguiding cable is also included in the scope of delivery. Due to the extreme resolution, even small guide scopes can be used, but care must be taken to use good optics so that the advantages of the high resolution can also be utilized.</p>
<p><em>Anti-reflective clear glass filter protects the sensor from dust:</em><br>The clear glass filter prevents dust from penetrating the sensor. It also lets UV and infrared light through so that you can also use the camera for infrared photography. With the right choice of contrast filters, nebula filters, IR pass filters or UV/IR blocking filters, you have full control over which light falls on the sensor.</p>
<p><em>Air cooling - reduces the sensor temperature:</em><br>As with all cameras, the sensor heats up during recording. The PCS dissipates the heat from the sensor via a heat conduction pad. The sensor temperature is therefore reduced by up to 15 degrees Celsius compared to cameras without PCS.</p>
<p><em>Very high sensitivity for short exposure times:</em><br>One advantage of the back-illuminated CMOS sensor is the reduced readout noise and improved sensitivity. In particular, Sony uses STARVIS-2 technology with the IMX662 sensor, which ensures excellent visibility in low light. You can achieve a very high light yield in astrophotography and realize high image quality not only in visible light, but also in the near infrared range (to reduce seeing). In addition, the low readout noise and the high full-well capacity ensure a wider dynamic range.<br>The low noise and anti-amp glow circuit make this camera very interesting for capturing small deep-sky objects too.</p>
<p><em>The HCG mode:</em><br>The camera has a built-in HCG mode that can effectively reduce the readout noise at high gain while maintaining the same wide dynamic range you would expect at low gain. When the gain is 150, the HCG mode turns on automatically. This results in the readout noise being below 1.4 e-, while the dynamic range can still reach almost 12.5 f-stops.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Lunar and planetary photography:</em><br>Due to the fine 2.9µm pixels, you achieve a very high resolution even from f/10, which even makes the use of Barlow lenses and converter systems unnecessary.</p>
<p><em>EAA (electronically assisted astronomy):</em><br>The high resolution, combined with a high frame rate of 95fps at full resolution (RAW8 format), allows real-time observation of planets as well as lots of details on the moon and sun.

SK0000269-UK,Bresser HD Deep Sky Camera - Colour,"<p><strong>The Bresser Full HD Deep Sky Camera with autoguider is a great camera for different types of astrophotography and for use as an autoguiding camera. Its not only suitable for photographing planets, but also for deep-sky objects such as galaxies, nebulae and star clusters. </strong></p>
<p>Dedicated ToupSky Astro Imaging software supports video preview, video recording, video processing, image capture and processing, dark field correction and raw data output. Its easy to use, but with professional results.</p>
<p>One of the main features of the new backlit SONY IMX290 CMOS sensor is its high light sensitivity, which makes it possible to detect deep-sky objects without active cooling. SONY has increased the quantum efficiency at 533nm wavelength up to 77%, which is much better than other CMOS sensors have been able to achieve in the past.</p>
<p>Connect this camera to a guidescope and attach the camera's built-in ST-4 port, directly to your telescope's equatorial mount guide port and you can also use this camera for autoguiding - using many popular audioguiding programs (such as PHD and more). Autoguiding enables you to take accurate pictures with long exposure times of several minutes. Thanks to the extra light-sensitive camera, you now always have a suitable guide star to hand, even using short exposure times. An ST-4 protocol connection cable is also included.</p>
<p>You can use this camera with all guiding telescopes, or off-axis guiders that accept a 1.25"" tube, 1.25"" filter thread (M28.5x0.6) or C-mount adapter thread (1 ""x1 /32"").</p>
<p><em>Important Note:</em></p>
<p>This is not a stand-alone camera. You always need a Windows 10/11 Laptop or computer to take pictures and for autoguiding.</p>

SK0000271-UK,"Optolong L-Ultimate Dual Narrowband Filter - 2""","The Optolong L-Ultimate dual narrowband filter is designed to drastically reduce the effect of light pollution and capture a very specific wavelength of light emitted from deep space emission and planetary nebula. Its two ultra-narrow 3 nm passing bands isolate the nebulae emissions in Ha (red) as well as OIII (green-blue).<br><br>This effectively means local light pollution is much less significant and even imaging during a full moon is possible too as all other wavelengths outside of the specific Ha and OIII signal are blocked from entering the camera. The L-Ultimate filter is literally the ultimate filter for astrophotography under urban light polluted skies.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Blocks the artificial light from mercury vapour lamps, both high and low pressure sodium vapour lights and the unwanted natural light caused by neutral oxygen emission in our atmosphere (skyglow).</li>
<li>Maximum transmission of the main nebula emission lines at OIII (496 nm and 500 nm) and H-alpha (656 nm)</li>
<li>Two transmission bands with a bandpass of 3nm each</li>
<li>Designed mainly for astrophotography with color cameras</li>
<li>Also helpful with monochrome cameras, no need to change filters for catching both lines</li>
<li>Ideal for urban areas with extreme light pollution</li>
<li>It incorporates an IR/UV cut filter that is necessary in astrophotography, especially for astronomy cameras that are sensitive to the infrared radiation.</li>
<li>Ultra-thin filter cell to maximise the compatibility with most filter wheels.</li>
<li>Multi-layered anti-reflection coating</li>
<li>No obvious halo around bright stars</li>
<li>Cell in an aerometal material, CNC machined, sand blasted, black anodized and laser engraved</li>
<li>Includes a PP plastic case, high pressure EVA case lining</li>
</ul>
The interferential coating is deposited on the substrate using electron-beam gun evaporation with Ion-assisted deposition coating technology. This essentially increases the filter durability and resistance to scratching, as well as stability on CWL (central wavelength) and no deviation affected by temperature changes. <br><br>The planetary rotation system offers precision and homogeneity of coatings ensuring high transmission of pass-band and high optical density off-band.<br><br><strong>Spec:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Transmitted lines: OIII (500.7 nm), H-alpha (656.3 nm)</li>

SK0000273-UK,"Optolong L-eXtreme Dual Narrowband Filter - 1.25""","<p><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">The L-eXtreme Filter is </span><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">perfect for deep sky nebula photography from the city as it uses much tighter narrowband limits - blocking out unwanted glow from the city. The relentless spread or urbanization and its associated light pollution have become a big problem for all amateur astro photographers around the world. One solution is to purchase a Mono camera but this can be expensive and might also require the purchase of several types of narrowband filters and a filter wheel.</span><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">These filters open up a whole new opportunity for fast newtonian telescopes, double-lens ED refractors or even achromats, allowing for extremely detailed and high class astronomical images even from heavy light polluted cities as it blocks out all artificial light pollution sources as it is a dual narrow bandpass filter, only allowing for the wavelengths of O-III and H-Alpha. This filter is fast bcoming a must have item for serious Astro-imagers using OSC cameras.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The L-eXtreme is a two 7NM narrow bandpass filter which can be used with one-shot color cameras like DSLRs (digital SLR), color CMOS and monochrome CCD cameras. The convenience and cost-effectiveness of this filter allows amateurs to photograph rich emission type nebulas, even in bright, heavily light-polluted skies. The L-eXtreme filter is the best choice for fast optical systems as it isolates the H-Alpha and Oxygen III nebula emission lines so that the contrast and signal-to-noise ratio between these are maximized.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">L-eXtreme has a multiple anti-reflective coatings on the optical substrate. The L-eXtreme filter uses a precision coating based on ion deposition coating technology. This ensures durability and scratch resistance as well as stability on the CWL (central wavelength), which is not affected by temperature changes. Absolute precision of the coatings as well as maximum values for transmission in the passband and optical density in the off-band range are guaranteed for all filters.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>IMPORTANT WARNING: These nebula filters are NOT designed for observation of the Sun.

SK0000306-UK,Celestron Heater Rings - (Various sizes),"<p>Glass surfaces such as telescope lenses pointing to the clear sky are prone to having dew forming on the lens during the night - especially if its humid. They also tend to capture stray light, which reduces the contrast of the target.</p>
<p>As many Astronomers and Astrophotographers have experienced, on clear nights dew is often a real problem and if it forms on your lens it can render your nights observing session over. After only a very short time, the optics can start fogging, making viewing or photography impossible. These Celestron Dew Protection Heater Rings are the ideal solution for preventing this problem.</p>
<p>The dew-protection heater rings are available in various sizes depending on your telescope OTA size and they replace the retaining ring on your existing Celestron Telescope. Installation is quick and easy <a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Celestron_Dew_Heater_Ring_Manual.pdf?v=1752321092"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">(Follow instructions in the manual here)</a>.</p>
<p><em>How does it work?</em><br>The dew-protection heater ring replaces the plastic retaining ring on your telescope's Schmidt plate and provides efficient heating of the front lens. The ring is made of lightweight, durable aluminum and its rigid frame supports both the cabling and the telescope's Schmidt plate. Unlike other heating bands or strips, which inefficiently heat the entire OTA cell to warm the glass, the Celestron dew-protection heater ring transfers heat directly to the Schmidt plate, providing the most efficient heat transfer to prevent dew formation.</p>
<p>Simply connect the ring to an external 12V DC Dew Heater power source for a consistent, continuous heat supply that prevents dew formation, even in high humidity. The dew-proof heating ring features two storage clips to safely store the power and thermistor connectors when not in use, and a dust cover for the telescope.</p>
<p>The dew-proof heater ring also comes with a cable management clip that can be attached to the front of the OTA. This allows you to secure the power and thermistor jack-plugs for strain relief and to neatly route the connecting cables.</p>
<p>The ring also includes an extension cable that allows it to be connected directly to one of the controller's heater outputs or to the heater output of another controller. (Note: The heated ring also has an integrated temperature probe (thermistor) however this is only compatible with Celestron's Smart Power and Dew Control box) We also recommend using a dew cap. While not required, it reduces the energy required by the dew heater ring to keep the optics clear.</p>

SK0000307-UK,ZWO ASI Dew Heater Band for Astro Cameras,"<p>There's nothing more frustrating than an imaging session cut short because of dew or frost forming on your optics. While dew heater bands can protect the optics of your telescope from this problem, it can also happen on your camera sensor itself, especially when you begin to cool it to sub zero temperatures.<br> <br>This anti-dew heater strip is used for anti-dew on the front window of the ASI cooled cameras (for ones which don't already have build in heaters). This kit includes the zip-tie, anti-dew heater strip, and a Y power cord.<br><br>The thickness of the anti-dew heater strip is 0.2~0.3 mm. The Y power cord is designed to connect in-line with the camera's cooler power supply for convenience. <br><br>We recommend a 12 V DC adapter with at least 0.35 A, as the heating power on the strip is approx. 4.2 watts. You can use the same power cord to power both fan and heater simultaneously, but its important to make sure not to exceed the recommended amount of amperes.</p>
<p><em>Features:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy adaptation to the front of the camera</li>
<li>No extra power supply required</li>
<li>These heaters are only compatible with the ZWO cameras, as it is controlled via the cameras electronics.</li>

<p>Dew condensation is caused by small droplets of water that occur on a surface when its surface temperature is less than the temperature of the moisture in the surrounding ambient air. Due to the nature of Astrophotography in the field, this is a common problem and it can render an imaging session cut short due to this occurring. As temperature and humidity change throughout the night and the camera becomes cooler than the ambient temperature, it is important to heat the lens of the lens or telescope by using heating elements to prevent the lens from fogging up.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">This lens heater is equipped with a detachable 50cm long power supply spiral cable (USB Type-C) and consumes only 3W of power (5V - 0.6A).

SK0000312-UK,Pegasus FocusCube V3 Motor Focus (For Celestron SCT Telescopes),"<p><strong>A must have for successful automated astrophotography sessions, this Auto-Focuser is fast, reliable and designed with high quality materials and modern electronics. FocusCube can provide digital precise focus control from a PC. </strong></p>
<p>The device includes a stepper motor for very accurate position focusing with all the electronics and stepper motors enclosed in a compact-sized box.</p>
<p>The stepper motor provides high speed, focus accuracy, and zero backlash. Attach the FocusCube Zero to your Celestron SCT telescope with the correct adapter, plug in the power, the USB cable and download ASCOM drivers or the Pegasus Unity platform and you are ready to go!</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTES:<br>FocusCube is a standalone device and includes full focus control functionality. No physical hand controller is included or required.<br><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DO NOT</span> pair it with the Dual Motor Focus Controller or any other controller on the market.<br><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DO NOT</span> connect this RJ45 port to the Ultimate Powerbox RJ45 Stepper Output - The RJ45 port at the back is only for the hand controller or the included temperature sensor.</p>
<p><em>Zero backlash stepper motor:</em><br>The embedded bipolar stepper motor provides a zero-backlash movement. The motor allows you to quickly move from any focus point to another. As there is no reduction gearbox the speed is suitable to move the primary mirror or focuser in or out at very fast rates.</p>
<p><em>Easy and repeatable V-Curve focus:</em><br>A V-Curve is the result of moving the focus of a telescope from an outside focus position into the focus and then further into the same direction out of focus again. With FocusCube Zero you can achieve a nearly perfect v-curve leading to a sharply focused image.</p>
<p><em>SCT bracket:</em><br>A special shaped black anodised aluminium bracket, which is stiff and hard to bend, can be attached to most of the Celestron SCT telescopes. Pegasus has successfully tested them on the following:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Celestron Classic &amp; EdgeHD 6, 8, 9.25<br>
</li>
<li>Celestron Classic &amp; Edge HD 11<br>
</li>
<li>Celestron Classic &amp; Edge HD 14<br>
</li>
<li>Celestron RASA 8""<br>
</li>
<li>Celestron RASA 11"" (V2 - for V1 you will need a separate Celestron Retrofit Kit)<br>
</li>
<li>Celestron RASA 14""</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">For Celestron SCT Telescopes:</span> Please note that Pegasus provides three different focuser adapters for the SCT range. The difference is in the metal pulley bore diameter &amp; the screw length in the package. Before purchasing please ensure you have selected the correct type.</p>
<p>Please note that some older SCT series are not compatible with the SCT bracket.</p>
<p><em>Temperature Probe:</em><br>An external digital temperature sensor input is located near the motor connector. A digital probe of one meter (3 feet) length is supplied. The probe can be placed near the focuser so the exact temperature of the focuser / environment can be seen through the supplied software or ASCOM driver.</p>
<p><em>Expansion Port / Manual Focus (optional accessory):</em><br>FocusCube includes an expansion RJ45 port at the back of the box. This port provides the input for the temperature sensor. An optional hand controller for manual focus control can be acquired separately for those who might want to add this functionality.</p>
<p><em>ASCOM supported:</em><br>The controller is fully compatible with latest ASCOM 6 version.</p>
<p><em>INDI (Open Astronomy Instrumentation) supported:</em><br>Pegasus Focuscube is fully compatible with INDI.</p>
<p>Official INDI Driver available <a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://indilib.org/devices/focusers/pegasus-dmfc.html"" target=""_blank"">Here</a></p>
<p><em>Firmware upgrade support:</em><br>Controller firmware supports re-programming via the USB 2.0 connection using upgrade software, for future upgrades which may become available. Pegasus Astro constantly receive feedback from customers and keep updating the firmware and software with new features.</p>
<p><em>Unity Platform Support:</em><br>Pegasus Astro Unity Platform is the new all around application. The goal is to provide a robust and modern application that is going to support current and future Pegasus products under one roof.</p>

SK0000317-UK,"TS Focus Motor Set for 2"" Focusers","<p><strong>This electrical focus motor allows you to focus your Telescope without touching the focuser by hand - this is very helpful when trying to avoid unwanted movement of the telescope while trying to focus at high magnifications as even the slightest touch of the telescope causes vibrations making precise focus a big challenge</strong></p>
<p>Apart from this, it is simply more comfortable and relaxing if you only need to press a button to control the telescope focuser and concentrate only on looking through the eyepiece or at the screen to reach the best possible focus sharpness.</p>
<p>For astrophotographers, a motor-driven focus drive like this is almost a necessity.<br>The image of the star is on the screen of the computer which is often located a bit further away from the focuser on the telescope, especially with Newtonian telescopes. A motor-driven focuser reduces the constant need to stand up and adjust the manual focuser.<br>Two large push-buttons on the controller allows for changing the direction of focuser movement and the controlling knob allows for adjusting the speed.</p>
<p>Mounting to focusers:<br>Included is a versatile base with long bores for adapting the this Focuser to the bottom side of the focuser on the telescope. The base is used for fixing the motor securely to the focuser itself.</p>
<p>Then, the motor itself is connected directly to the focuser shaft by a flexible connection.</p>
<p>This focuser is suitable for Skywatcher and Orion Crayford focusers, but can also be easily adapted to many other fosusers with a bit of technical skill.</p>
<p><em>Our Recommendation:</em><br><em>If you are a planetary imager or are visually looking at the Moon or Planets through the eyepiece then we would definitely recommend this focuser as you will likely be viewing at very high magnification meaning any vibrations as a result of manual focusing will be amplified much more and will make reaching optimal focus and sharpness a very difficult task.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Using a Bahtinov Mask for focusing works really well for Deep Sky astrophotography. Correctors and Barlow Lenses are also fine to use too.</li>
<li>Ideally you want to use a star with medium brightness for focusing. It should neither be too dark nor too bright. The lines of the Bahtinov interference pattern will need to be clearly visible.</li>
<li>The chosen star shouldn´t be positioned in the center of your live view, because most telescopes or lenses, although corrected, do not produce a flat field of view. We recommend positioning your selected star to the outer part of your field of view, That way, you will achieve a better overall sharpness across your whole field of view.</li>

SK0000324-UK,"ZWO Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC) - 1.25""","<p><strong>What is an atmospheric dispersion corrector:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">An ADC corrector is a small unit that corrects the refraction of light in the atmosphere. For example, a large object like Jupiter has a red and blue color fringe and also appears distorted. This effect is caused by the refraction of light in the Earths atmosphere which acts like a prism. This effect becomes more prominent, depending on how high the object is above the horizon. The deeper the object is, the stronger the effect comes into play. Since especially in northern countries the planets are only very low, the effect here is particularly strong, and the corrector is particularly worthwhile here.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>How does the ZWO ADC corrector work?</em><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Our atmosphere refracts the light to varying degrees, depending on the wavelength. Red light is refracted differently than blue light. The closer the object is to the horizon, the stronger the effect. With the adjustment levers on the ADC, you adjust the two prisms in the corrector and thus counteract the effect of the Earth's atmosphere, neutralizing this color shift. this makes a huge difference to the clarity and sharpness of your images.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>Important Tip for use: </em></p>
<ol>
<li>For the maximum effect, the corrector must be correctly oriented to the horizon. This is usually the case when the superimposed handles of the compensator are parallel to the horizon line in the focuser.</li>
<li>It should be noted that in the case of equatorially mounted telescopes, the position to the horizon changes over time, which must of course be taken into account.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connections on the corrector: T2 female/male thread</li>
<li>Also included: 1.25"" receptacle for telescope and 1.25"" adapter with ring clamping for eyepiece</li>

The narrow bandpass for the wavelengths of O-III, H-Beta and H-Alpha really help control the impact from light polluted skies.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">L-eNhance has a multiple anti-reflective coating on the optical substrate which uses a precision coating based on ion deposition coating technology. This ensures durability and scratch resistance as well as stability on the CWL (central wavelength), which is not affected by temperature changes.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><em>IMPORTANT WARNING: These nebula filters are NOT designed for observation of the Sun.

SK0000341-UK,Pegasus - Camera Field Rotator V2,"<p><strong>The Pegasus Astro Falcon Rotator V2 is a light-weighted, low profile camera field rotator. Its very easy to operate via ASCOM drivers or by using standalone software which will make your life much easier by allowing you to automatically adjust your exact camera field of view with precision.</strong></p>
<p>Operating the Falcon Rotator V2 is a seamless experience, thanks to its compatibility with classic ASCOM, native ASCOM Alpaca drivers and the Unity Platform software. This user-friendly design simplifies the process of automatically and precisely orienting your camera field, making your astrophotography endeavors significantly more convenient and efficient.</p>
<p><em>M68 threads on both sides and low profile:</em><br>Both sides of the rotator are M68 threaded, so it is possible to use large sensors without vignetting. The thickness of the rotator is just 15.5mm and the weight only 700g, but it can handle a 6kg payload.</p>
<p><em>Adapters for both sides:</em><br>There are adapters for many common threads available which can be purchased separately.</p>
<p><em>Precise rotation:</em><br>A powerful geared / low backlash stepper motor ensures that the rotator will lock to the designated degree angle. High quality mechanical components inside the focuser prevent flexure at any point during a full circle rotation.</p>
<p><em>High rated load:</em><br>Falcon Rotator V2 has been tested at 6Kg (13lbs) of imaging setup. The mechanical design allows it to custom tighten internal bearing so it can easily handle higher payloads with almost zero flexure.</p>
<p><em>One Cable Operation:</em><br>The rotator can be connected with a USB-C cable for both power and data, reducing complexity in your telescope setup. Additionally, it´s Wi-Fi enabled, allowing you to control your field rotation remotely from your mobile phone.</p>
<p><em>Field De-Rotation support for Alt/Az mounts:</em><br>The rotator has the mechanical precision to achieve field de-rotation. The supplied Unity Platform calculates Rate of Rotation (RoR) based on the site latitude, target altitude and azimuth position. By fine-tuning the micro-step drive control of the motor, derotation can achieve a resolution as precise as 5 arc-seconds.</p>
<p><em>ASCOM &amp; INDI support:</em><br>The rotator is fully ASCOM 6 supported. INDI support will follow by the time of the launch.</p>
<p><em>Standalone software:</em><br>Control the Falcon Rotator with the supplied standalone Windows software.</p>

SK0000350-UK,"Celestron NexStar Evolution - 8"" SC","<p><strong>Celestron's computer-controlled telescopes reach the next level with the NexStar Evolution: the first Schmidt-Cassegrains with built-in WiFi. You no longer need a hand controller - point the telescope at the most beautiful celestial objects with a click on your smartphone or tablet. </strong></p>
<p>Connect your mobile device to the wireless network of your NexStar Evolution telescope and explore the universe with the Celestron app for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>The planetarium program on your smartphone shows you the current sky view or a list of observation targets for your location. The easy-to-use SkyAlign is integrated into the Celestron app, so you can set up the telescope and adjust the three reference stars in just a few minutes.</p>
<p><em>Simple and convenient operation:</em><br>The NexStar Evolution telescopes have been developed based on customer feedback from the past few years. They offer many well thought-out details so that you can enjoy the most beautiful night possible under the starry sky. </p>
<p>No more worrying about batteries or an external power supply. The NexStar Evolution is the first amateur telescope to have a built-in lithium iron phosphate battery. One charge lasts up to ten hours. You can even use the Evolution's USB port to power other devices you want to use at night.</p>
<p>The NexStar Evolution is easy to set up thanks to the large, ergonomic handles. The steel tripod has markings so you can easily extend all legs to the same length. The azimuth and elevation clamps allow you to point the telescope at a target even without power. Up to seven eyepieces can be stored in two storage compartments - one even has a dimmable red LED light.</p>
<p>More power and safety thanks to lithium iron phosphate battery:<br>Instead of a typical lithium polymer battery, a lithium iron phosphate battery is used in the Evolution telescopes. These LiFePO 4 batteries have several advantages over simple LiPo batteries:</p>
<p><strong>High safety &amp; Reliability:</strong><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike LiPo batteries, LiFePO 4 batteries cannot explode or ignite, but are considered intrinsically safe. The improved power density ensures a high load capacity even with continuous current consumption.<br>

<p>If you're interested in astrophotography, a NexStar Evolution is an excellent and affordable way to get started. It's the only fork-mounted telescope series in this price range with worm gears, along with improved motors. Planetary photography with a DSLR or a planetary camera is also no problem at all, and with a polar wedge you can also set it up equatorially to take long exposure deep sky images, be it with a DSLR or an Astro Camera.</p>
<p>The Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes with the StarBright XLT coating deliver bright, sharp images and are just as interesting for visual observers as they are for astrophotographers.</p>
<p>The NexStar Evolution telescopes come with a StarPointer finder scope, two 1.25” Plössl eyepieces, a star diagonal, power supply and a hand controller.</p>

SK0000351-UK,Celestron CPC 1100 - GPS,"<p><strong>The CPC 1100 GPS XLT is the portable fork-mounted top-class telescope from Celestron and features the StarBright XLT coating. The telescope is perfect for visual observations and, with an optional polar wedge and an astro camera, also enables professional astrophotography.</strong></p>
<p>If you point the telescope at the planets, you'll see fascinating details on the surface of Jupiter, the Cassini division of Saturn's rings, and surface details on Mars. Even Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are within your reach.</p>
<p><em>Professional XLT computer telescopes:</em><br>With the CPC series, Celestron is introducing the most stable fork mount that has ever been available in the 40 years of production of Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. The completely newly designed tripod and a huge 280mm ball bearing in the fork base enable vibration-free observation even at the highest magnifications.</p>
<p>The azimuthal fork mount is not as variable as the German mount, as it is tailored to the tube diameter. This disadvantage is compensated for by the compact design, low weight, good portability and, most importantly, incredibly quick setup. You are ready to observe in just a few minutes. Simply set up the tripod, level it with the built-in bubble level, put on the fork mount - and switch it on.</p>
<p><em>Built-in GPS:</em><br>The 16-channel GPS receiver transmits the time, date and location coordinates to the electronics. This means you no longer have to enter the time and location yourself - the telescope automatically has the exact data.</p>
<p><em>Sky Align:</em><br>This is the name of the brand new alignment process from Celestron for perfect GoTo positioning. The telescope no longer needs a defined base position: you place three bright stars (planets and the moon are also possible) in the field of view of the telescope one after the other and voilá, your CPC telescope is ready for automatic GoTo positioning on any object from the hand control database.</p>
<p>SkyAlign calculates the setup of your telescope from the travel distances of the three stars and the corresponding angles. SkyAlign also gets the other data required (date, time, and location coordinates) via the integrated 16-channel GPS receiver.</p>
<p>""SkyAlign"" only works when the telescope is in azimuthal operation, i.e. when the telescope is operated directly on the tripod without a polar wedge. But Celestron also has some new and simplified alignment methods for parallactic operation in the CPC series.</p>
<p><em>Extensive database:</em><br>The CPC telescope database contains over 40,000 celestial objects, including the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as galaxies and nebulae from the NGC catalog and the planets. You can narrow down your selection to make searching this comprehensive database easier and to hide objects that are currently below the horizon.</p>
<p>The ""Identify"" function tells you what you are currently seeing in the telescope and also allows you to easily explore the sky. Simply point the telescope at any area of the sky and have it show you, for example, the nearest Messier objects - the telescope will navigate to them for you. You can do this in different areas of the sky and with different objects!</p>
<p><em>The CPC telescopes also score points with the following details:</em><br>The azimuthal fork mount has been completely redesigned. It is less susceptible to vibrations and the drive motors and gears run ""whisper quiet"" in GoTo mode. The tripod that supports the mount and telescope has also become more stable.<br>The completely newly designed tripod (landing pad) has a self-centering mounting device - no searching in the dark for the right attachment point for the mounting foot on the tripod. By rotating the mount on the tripod, the screw holes lock into the right position. Three spring-supported screws, which are anchored in the tripod, enable quick and, above all, effortless assembly in a matter of seconds. The built-in bubble level makes leveling easier. The large tripod triangle also serves as a storage area for several eyepieces.</p>
<p><em>Other features include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Illuminated on/off switch on the top of the housing - so no more searching in the dark,<br>
</li>
<li>Large, easy-to-grip clamping wheels (suitable for gloves) in both axles instead of fiddly small clamping levers,<br>
</li>
<li>The ""Permanent PEC"" function stores the periodic errors of the screw to improve the tracking accuracy,<br>
</li>
<li>The electronics work with all autoguiders and planetarium programs available on the market,<br>
</li>
<li>The ""Alignment Sync"" function allows you to improve positioning accuracy during operation by confirming a new alignment object,<br>
</li>
<li>The ""Precise Goto"" function allows very faint objects to be brought extremely precisely into the center of the field of view or a CCD chip. First, a bright star close to the object being searched for is selected by the electronics and moved to it. The observer must then move it precisely to the center of the field of view using the arrow keys on the hand controller. The computer then calculates the distance from this star to the object being searched for and moves to it with high precision.<br>
</li>
<li>Finally, another new ""feature"" of the hand controls of version 4.0 of the CPC series: thanks to a flash EPROM, the control and motor software can be upgraded via the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong><br>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case. Suitable high-quality power supplies can be found on the left under Optional Accessories.</p>

SK0000352-UK,Celestron CPC 925 HD - Deluxe,"<p><strong>The CPC 925 HD Deluxe is the portable fork-mounted top-class telescope from Celestron and features the StarBright XLT coating. The telescope is perfect for visual observations and, with an optional polar wedge and an astro camera, also enables professional astrophotography.</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Optical Design:</strong><br>EdgeHD (Edge High Definition) optics combine the compact design of a Schmidt-Cassegrain with significantly improved image quality at the edge of the image. This optical system not only offers astrograph characteristics, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view. This not only corrects off-axis coma—as with other so-called ""coma-free"" optical designs available on the market—but also field curvature! All EdgeHD telescopes deliver a large, flat field of view, enabling sharp star images even at the edge of large CCD sensors.</p>
<p><strong>Built-in GPS:</strong><br>The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature a built-in GPS sensor that automatically receives the date, time, and your exact location from the GPS satellites. This eliminates the need to manually enter this data.</p>
<p><strong>SkyAlign:</strong><br>This is Celestron's incredibly easy alignment process for perfect GoTo positioning. The telescope no longer requires a defined home position: Simply align three bright stars (planets and the moon are also possible) one after the other in the telescope's field of view, and voilà! Your CPC telescope is ready for automatic GoTo positioning to any object from the hand control's database.</p>
<p>SkyAlign calculates your telescope's alignment based on the trajectories of the three stars and the corresponding angles. SkyAlign retrieves the other required data (date, time, and location coordinates) via the integrated 16-channel GPS receiver.</p>
<p>"" SkyAlign "" only works in azimuthal mode, i.e., when the telescope is operated directly on the tripod without a polar wedge. Celestron also offers several new and simplified alignment methods for equatorial operation in the CPC series.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Database:</strong><br>The CPC telescope database contains over 40,000 celestial objects, including the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as galaxies and nebulae from the NGC catalog and planets. You can narrow down your search to simplify your search in this comprehensive database and hide objects that are currently below the horizon.</p>
<p>The ""Identify"" function tells you what you're currently seeing in the telescope, and it also lets you easily explore the sky. Simply point the telescope at any area of the sky and, for example, display the nearest Messier objects—the telescope will move to them for you. You can do this in different areas of the sky and with different objects!</p>
<p>With ""Solar Sys Align"" you can align the telescope using the sun or moon even during the day to observe the planets or the brightest stars in the daytime sky.</p>
<p>Hyperstar Compatible: All EdgeHD tubes allow you to remove and replace the secondary mirror. The result: With the optional HyperStar optics, your standard Celestron EdgeHD telescope becomes a digital Schmidt Design for your CCD or DSLR camera for primary focus photography.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative features of the Mount:</strong></p>
<p>Design - For the CPC Deluxe HD telescopes, Celestron has redesigned the drive mechanism. It features a 15 cm (6 inch) brass gear with 180 teeth and a stainless steel worm gear, as well as a unique steel and nylon ball bearing design for even smoother tracking for long-exposure deep-sky imaging.</p>
<p>Innovation - The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature the innovative All-Star™ Polar Alignment . When used with the optional polar wedge, you can align the telescope to any bright star in equatorial mode—no need to look at Polaris! Astrophotographers will also appreciate the Permanent Periodic Error Correction (PEC) feature. You can record the helical error so it's automatically corrected in the future.</p>
<p>Power Management - The redesigned electronics supply the motors with constantly regulated voltage, allowing them to move the telescope even when it's not fully balanced. This maintains smooth operation and high GoTo accuracy.</p>
<p>Performance - You can track objects far beyond the meridian, allowing you to observe the most interesting part of the sky without interruption.<br>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</p>

SK0000353-UK,Celestron CPC 1100 HD - Deluxe,"<p><strong>The CPC 1100 HD Deluxe is the portable fork-mounted top-class telescope from Celestron and features the StarBright XLT coating. The telescope is perfect for visual observations and, with an optional polar wedge and an astro camera, also enables professional astrophotography.</strong></p>
<p>As the largest instrument in this series, the CPC Deluxe 1100 HD telescope gathers the most light out of all the range - almost 90% more than the 8"" model and still over 40% more than the 9.25"" model. The CPC Deluxe features the newly redesigned fork mount and modern EdgeHD optics.</p>
<p>Thanks to sophisticated software features such as the hibernate function, the telescope remembers its position from one night to the next - assuming it is not moved during that time, of course. This makes it ideal for permanent installation in an observatory. Yet it is compact enough to be easily transported to an observing site.</p>
<p>The conveniently positioned carrying handles and an instrument weight of just under 30kg make it easy to set up in your own garden or transport to your favorite observing spot.</p>
<p><strong>New Optical Design:</strong><br>EdgeHD (Edge High Definition) optics combine the compact design of a Schmidt-Cassegrain with significantly improved image quality at the edge of the image. This optical system not only offers astrograph characteristics, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view. This not only corrects off-axis coma—as with other so-called ""coma-free"" optical designs available on the market—but also field curvature! All EdgeHD telescopes deliver a large, flat field of view, enabling sharp star images even at the edge of large CCD sensors.</p>
<p><strong>Built-in GPS:</strong><br>The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature a built-in GPS sensor that automatically receives the date, time, and your exact location from the GPS satellites. This eliminates the need to manually enter this data.</p>
<p><strong>SkyAlign:</strong><br>This is Celestron's incredibly easy alignment process for perfect GoTo positioning. The telescope no longer requires a defined home position: Simply align three bright stars (planets and the moon are also possible) one after the other in the telescope's field of view, and voilà! Your CPC telescope is ready for automatic GoTo positioning to any object from the hand control's database.</p>
<p>SkyAlign calculates your telescope's alignment based on the trajectories of the three stars and the corresponding angles. SkyAlign retrieves the other required data (date, time, and location coordinates) via the integrated 16-channel GPS receiver.</p>
<p>"" SkyAlign "" only works in azimuthal mode, i.e., when the telescope is operated directly on the tripod without a polar wedge. Celestron also offers several new and simplified alignment methods for equatorial operation in the CPC series.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Database:</strong><br>The CPC telescope database contains over 40,000 celestial objects, including the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as galaxies and nebulae from the NGC catalog and planets. You can narrow down your search to simplify your search in this comprehensive database and hide objects that are currently below the horizon.</p>
<p>The ""Identify"" function tells you what you're currently seeing in the telescope, and it also lets you easily explore the sky. Simply point the telescope at any area of the sky and, for example, display the nearest Messier objects—the telescope will move to them for you. You can do this in different areas of the sky and with different objects!</p>
<p>With ""Solar Sys Align"" you can align the telescope using the sun or moon even during the day to observe the planets or the brightest stars in the daytime sky.</p>
<p>Hyperstar Compatible: All EdgeHD tubes allow you to remove and replace the secondary mirror. The result: With the optional HyperStar optics, your standard Celestron EdgeHD telescope becomes a digital Schmidt Design for your CCD or DSLR camera for primary focus photography.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative features of the Mount:</strong></p>
<p>Design - For the CPC Deluxe HD telescopes, Celestron has redesigned the drive mechanism. It features a 15 cm (6 inch) brass gear with 180 teeth and a stainless steel worm gear, as well as a unique steel and nylon ball bearing design for even smoother tracking for long-exposure deep-sky imaging.</p>
<p>Innovation - The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature the innovative All-Star™ Polar Alignment . When used with the optional polar wedge, you can align the telescope to any bright star in equatorial mode—no need to look at Polaris! Astrophotographers will also appreciate the Permanent Periodic Error Correction (PEC) feature. You can record the helical error so it's automatically corrected in the future.</p>
<p>Power Management - The redesigned electronics supply the motors with constantly regulated voltage, allowing them to move the telescope even when it's not fully balanced. This maintains smooth operation and high GoTo accuracy.</p>
<p>Performance - You can track objects far beyond the meridian, allowing you to observe the most interesting part of the sky without interruption.<br>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</p>

SK0000355-UK,Vixen WiFi Adapter Module,"<p><strong>The Vixen Wifi adapter for EQ mounts eleminates the need for the Star Book Ten hand controller and allows you to control your Vixen mount via a smartphone or tablet via a WiFi connection.</strong><br><br>With the smartphone app Star Book Wireless (free of charge) you can perform celestial navigation without any wiring. The app turns your smartphone or tablet into a controller for the equatorial mount in no time. The response delay of the mount, which is considered the biggest disadvantage of wireless connections, has been reduced to a level comparable to wired ones. </p>
<p>Reduced power consumption compared to conventional controllers with LCD monitor <br>The power consumption of the mount is reduced by up to 20%, allowing longer observations than with conventional wired controllers such as the Star Book Ten. </p>
<p><strong>Operation similar to the Star Book Ten controller:</strong><br>The Star Book Wireless app has a similar structure to the Star Book Ten controller. Tap on a celestial object in the object list and start the GoTo. The mount will now automatically move to this target and bring it into the telescope's field of view. All the popular features of the Star Book Ten are available.</p>
<p><strong>Convenient operation:</strong><br>When looking through the telescope operate the mount by swiping on the app's star map. Since there are no buttons, simply slide your finger over the star chart for convenient operation of the mount. </p>
<p><strong>Extensive astronomical data included:</strong><br>This includes data on easily observable celestial bodies such as Messier objects, NGC objects, IC objects as well as the Sun, Moon, planets, comets and dwarf planets. </p>
<p><strong>High-precision alignment:</strong><br>By aligning to one or two stars, you already get a fairly accurate positioning of the mount. By aligning to three or more stars, you can achieve high-precision alignment of the mount for high magnifications. The objects will then be approached precisely and centrally in your telescope's field of view. The alignment information is stored and can be retained even when the telescope is switched off. By leaving the telescope in its current state without moving it after completing an observation, the next time you observe you can start the automatic setup with the same settings for the next observation. </p>
<p><strong>Individual setting options:</strong><br>As with the Star Book Ten controller, the app offers various individual settings, such as gear backlash compensation, night mode in red, autoguider and variable GoTo speed and LED brightness. You can also set the timing of the lens tube inversion (meridian flip) as desired. Even if the object moves south during tracking, you can prevent the telescope tube from inverting. </p>

SK0000369-UK,TS-Optics x0.73 Reducer for Newtonians,"<p><strong>Newtonian Coma Corrector and 0.73x Focal Reducer for your Newtonian telescope:</strong><br></p>
<p>This corrector increases the speed of your Newtonian telescope and corrects for Newtonian coma. The exposure times during astrophotography can essentially be almost halved. This corrector was designed by H. Ackermann (USA).</p>
<p><em>The corrector is usable for the following Newtonian telescopes:</em><br>Basically, the corrector/reducer can be used with all Newtonians from f/3.5 to f/8. It has an M48 thread at the camera side. The adapter shifts back the focal plane by 15-16 millimetres. This value results from the reduction factor of the reducer. You need approximately 85mm from the 2"" receptacle of the focuser to the focus to make the reducer operational. UNC and ONTC Newtonian telescopes from TS Optics can be prepared for the use of this special corrector.</p>
<p>Because of the increased speed, you also have to pay attention to accurate clamping because even minimal tilting results directly in unsharp stars at the edge of the field.</p>
<p><em>Usable image field of the TS-Optics corrector-reducer:</em><br>The design of the corrector allows for a usable field of 22mm diameter with 100% illumination. With a little trick during focusing, this field can be extended to approx. 30mm - For example, don't use a star in the middle of the field, but use a medium bright one in the outer third of the field.</p>
<p><em>Practical tip - how do I get 55mm working distance using this corrector?</em><br>The distance of the corrector is 67mm (+/- 0.5mm) from the M48 connection thread. The working distance is always calculated from the corrector to the camera which is typically 55mm for most cameras :<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Distance 55mm with T2 connection: Using a 1mm spacing ring , a 5mm Extension , an M48x0.75 to T2 high profile adapter<br>
</li>
<li>Distance 55mm with M48 connection: Using a 1mm spacing ring (x2) , a 10mm Extension</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spec:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Barrel size: 2""<br>
</li>
<li>Connection thread at the camera side: 2"" filter thread (M48x0.75)<br>
</li>
<li>Working distance from the camera thread: 67mm to the sensor (+/- 0.5mm)<br>
</li>
<li>Reduction: Focal length reduced to 0.73x<br>
