<strong>This high resolution and very capable deep sky Astro camera comes with a large Panasonic CMOS sensor and active camera cooling.</strong><br>With the new Explore Scientific Deep Sky Astro camera you get a modern complete package for the comfortable shooting of astro photos and videos. Finally, an easy-to-use camera for capturing galaxies, star clusters, the moon and even planets with high resolution and very low sensor noise. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred within a seconds. Long waiting times are now a thing of the past.<br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope using the T2 female thread (M42.0.75mm) or the supplied 2"" (50.8mm) plug-in adapter and after installing the drivers and the included 'Explore Capture' recording and editing software, you are ready to take your Astro photos to the next level.<br>The Explore Capture Pro software included not only offers the basic functions required for image and video capture, but also many helpful special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Functions such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, time-lapse recording and so much more can be configured separately.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Choose to use the automatic settings to produce absolutely fantastic results without any previous knowledge or simply switch off the automatic settings and adjust the individual professional settings to your own preference - Its up to you.<br>The new Explore Deep Sky Camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise Panasonic CMOS sensor which can also be cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. In contrast to normal DSLR cameras, this guarantees much lower noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots. This results in images that are not only much sharper and more brilliant, but also contain more usable image information.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Through the controlled setting of the desired camera temperature, you can now produce dark frames under reproducible shooting conditions at any time. The large-format CMOS sensor with 21.9mm diagonal also allows large image fields and makes the adjustment and centering of objects considerably easier. <br>The camera has a built-in USB hub with 2 x USB2.0 ports at the rear. Connect your additional Auto-guider camera or motor focus etc. via a short USB cable and reduce the risk of cable spaghetti and cable breaks. Separate cable connections between your accessories and your computer are also no longer necessary. <br></div>

This Air Blower is a simple yet an essential part of any astronomers Telescope maintenance kit. This simple device allows you to blow off any particles or fine dust either prior to use or prior to cleaning your telescope optics.</p>
<p>Simply squeeze the large bulb to create a jet of air through the nozzle to safely blow off any small particles or dust off your optics. This is also the first important step when cleaning your optics as it helps to prevents minute particles getting rubbed into your lens or mirrors during the cleaning process which can cause small surface scratches.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Perfect for blowing off any dust or particles from your Telescope correctors, eyepieces, filters and camera sensors prior to fitting to your telescope.</li>
<li>Can be used on Lenses, Mirrors, Cameras, Eyepieces, Filters and all other optical equipment </li>
