         "<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>This high resolution and very capable deep sky Astro camera comes with a large Panasonic CMOS sensor and active camera cooling.</strong><br>With the new Explore Scientific Deep Sky Astro camera you get a modern complete package for the comfortable shooting of astro photos and videos. Finally, an easy-to-use camera for capturing galaxies, star clusters, the moon and even planets with high resolution and very low sensor noise. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred within a seconds. Long waiting times are now a thing of the past.<br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope using the T2 female thread (M42.0.75mm) or the supplied 2\" (50.8mm) plug-in adapter and after installing the drivers and the included 'Explore Capture' recording and editing software, you are ready to take your Astro photos to the next level.<br>The Explore Capture Pro software included not only offers the basic functions required for image and video capture, but also many helpful special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Functions such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, time-lapse recording and so much more can be configured separately.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Choose to use the automatic settings to produce absolutely fantastic results without any previous knowledge or simply switch off the automatic settings and adjust the individual professional settings to your own preference - Its up to you.<br>The new Explore Deep Sky Camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise Panasonic CMOS sensor which can also be cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. In contrast to normal DSLR cameras, this guarantees much lower noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots. This results in images that are not only much sharper and more brilliant, but also contain more usable image information.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Through the controlled setting of the desired camera temperature, you can now produce dark frames under reproducible shooting conditions at any time. The large-format CMOS sensor with 21.9mm diagonal also allows large image fields and makes the adjustment and centering of objects considerably easier. <br>The camera has a built-in USB hub with 2 x USB2.0 ports at the rear. Connect your additional Auto-guider camera or motor focus etc. via a short USB cable and reduce the risk of cable spaghetti and cable breaks. Separate cable connections between your accessories and your computer are also no longer necessary. <br></div>\n<div>\n<br><strong>Key Camera Features:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Camera type: ASTRO Camera 16.0MP ATR3CMOS16000KPA </li>\n<li>Data output: single pictures and video </li>\n<li>Image Sensor: Panasonic NM34230PLI CMOS Color Sensor </li>\n<li>Adjustable resolution: 4648x3506 / 2304x1750 / 1536x1168 </li>\n<li>Adjustable binning: 1x1 / 2x2 / 3x3 </li>\n<li>Frame rate per second (FBS): 22.5 / 43 / 48 </li>\n<li>Physical sensor size in pixels: 4648 x 3506 </li>\n<li>Megapixel: 16 MP </li>\n<li>Sensor size: 17.6 x 13.3 mm (4/3 inch) </li>\n<li>Pixel size: 3.8 µm x 3.8 µm </li>\n<li>Bit depth: 12 Bit </li>\n<li>Backfocus: 17,5 mm  </li>\n<li>Shutter Type: rolling shutter</li>\n<li>Internal camera memory: DDR 3 RAM</li>\n<li>Thermoelectric cooling with fan: yes, up to 40°C below ambient temperature </li>\n<li>Adjustable exposure times: 150µs to 60min </li>\n<li>Operating temperature: -10 to +50°C (30-80% RLH) </li>\n<li>Cable length USB 3.0: 150cm </li>\n<li>DC cable length power supply: 200cm </li>\n<li>CNC machined aluminium housing </li>\n<li>Camera diameter: 80mm; length: 102mm </li>\n<li>Camera weight: 0,53 kg </li>\n<li>Camera connection diameter: 2.0 inch ( 50.8mm) </li>\n<li>Camera connection thread: T2 (M42x0,75mm) </li>\n<li>Filter thread: Yes, 2.0 inch in receptacle </li>\n<li>Camera connection to PC: USB 3.0 </li>\n<li>Built-in USB hub with 2 x USB 2.0 ports </li>\n<li>Power supply: Power supply 12 Volt 3,0 Ampere included </li>\n<li>Software: EXPLORE Capture included </li>\n<li>Camera driver and ASCOM driver included</li>\n<li>Operating system: WINDOWS 7, 8 and 10 </li>\n<li>PC requirements: CPU Intel Core2 2.8Ghz or higher / 2 GB Ram / USB 3.0<br></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>General Technical Data:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>One Shot Colour Astro Camera 16.0MP</li>\n<li>Material: Blue - Aluminium Casing</li>\n<li>Dimensions: Length 102mm, Diameter 80mm</li>\n<li>Net Weight: 530g (without Accessories) </li>\n<li>Telescope adapter T2 thread to 2.0\" (50,8mm) </li>\n<li>USB 3.0 connection cable 150cm </li>\n<li>Power supply 230V/12V3,0A (Included) </li>\n<li>Dust cap</li>\n<li>Software CD </li>\n<li>Hard case </li>\n<li>Instruction manual</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div><span><strong>DOWNLOAD YOUR CAMERA SOFTWARE &amp; MANUAL HERE:</strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Download the Astro Cam ASCOM &amp; Software Drivers <a>here</a></span></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

         "<p><strong>For many years Bresser Newtonian telescopes have become the standard workhorse for Deep Sky astrophotography, now the second generation of this telescope, the Bresser NT-203s/800 comes with an improved Hexafoc focusser and fast parabolic main mirror. </strong></p>\n<p>The Bresser NT-203s/800 f3.9 will deliver you much more detailed images at shorter exposures due to its oversized primary mirror and therefore faster optical system (f3.9, compared to standard f5 telescopes of this size). The large 85 mm secondary mirror also helps reduce vignetting for maximum optimal illumination of the target. The excellent 2,5\" Hexafoc focuser also helps reduce vignetting due to its large diameter and makes focussing a joy - the smoothness and shifting-free operation sets a new standard in this price class.<br><em>BRESSER EXOS-2 Equatorial Mount:</em><br>The Bresser EXOS-2 is a rugged German Equatorial Mount offering high rigidity and precision tracking for visual observation as well as astrophotography. The tripod is extremely sturdy and designed to suppress vibrations very well. As with all the Bressier Messier range, this mount is built to extremely high standards and comes with an illuminated polar finder scope and precise graduated circles for more accuracy and ease of use during polar alignement. - If you wish at a later stage to upgrade the mount to a full computerised GOTO system, a powered two axis GOTO-Kit is available as an optional extra. The EXOS-2 mounts is designed to take a max payload weight up to 13kg allowing you to use refractors of up to 152 mm aperture or mirror telescopes of up to 203 mm aperture.<br><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optical design: Newtonian Reflector</li>\n<li>Mirror diameter: 203mm / focal length: 800mm / F/3.9</li>\n<li>Maximum recommended magnification: x 406</li>\n<li>Telescope for night and solar observing</li>\n<li>Very high quality Hexafoc focuser with 2.5\" free inner diameter</li>\n<li>Diffraction limited optics with parabolic main mirror</li>\n<li>8x50 straight through viewfinder with reticle</li>\n<li>Optimized finder socket for comfortable use</li>\n<li>Cradle rings with handle and integrated piggyback camera holder (1/4 thread)</li>\n<li>Smartphone adapter for celestial navigation included</li>\n<li>Dovetail plate with stainless steel rail</li>\n<li>Can be connected to SLR cameras (optional T2 ring required)</li>\n<li>50.8mm (2) to 31.7mm (1.25) adapter with integrated T2 thread (T2-adapter ring for your camera is needed)</li>\n<li>Backfocus fully inward focused: 60mm</li>\n<li>85mm secondary mirror for optimal illumination</li>\n<li>Large knobs for primary and secondary mirror adjustment</li>\n<li>Tube without accessories: 8.7 kg - Tube with all accessories mounted: 11.5 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Mount Spec:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Stable parallactic mount with fine drive in both axes</li>\n<li>Ball bearings in both axes for more precise movements</li>\n<li>Stable height adjustable stainless steel tripod ( Min. 69cm / Max. 109.5cm )</li>\n<li>Load capacity up to 13 kg payload</li>\n<li>Circular bubble for easy horizontal alignment</li>\n<li>(Optional) GoTo system with motors and hand box controller is available as an upgrade.</li>\n<li>ST-4 compatible autoguider interface</li>\n<li>Pole height scale for setting the latitude</li>\n<li>Scaled graduated circular rings to facilitate finding objects using a star atlas or planetarium software</li>\n<li>Pole finder scope with optional illumination ( item no. 4964212 )</li>\n<li>Tripod weight: 4.6 kg</li>\n<li>Mount weight: 5.3 kg (without counterweight)</li>\n<li>Total weight incl. counterweight: 23.6 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weight &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Net weight OTA (incl. accessories): 11.5 kg</li>\n<li>Total length: 100 cm</li>\n<li>Total width: 100 cm</li>\n<li>Total height: 175 cm</li>\n<li>Tube diameter: 235 mm</li>\n<li>Tube length: 700 mm</li>\n<li>Net Weight total (incl. accessories): 30.5 kg</li>\n<li>Net weight mount (incl. accessories): 19 kg</li>\n<li>Counterweights: 2 x 4.5 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OTA<br></li>\n<li>26mm Super Plössl eyepiece (31.7mm / 1.25\")</li>\n<li>Integrated 31.7 mm and T2 adapter</li>\n<li>Prism rail with stainless steel clamping surface</li>\n<li>Adapter for 50.8 mm (2\") eyepieces</li>\n<li>8x50 optical viewfinder</li>\n<li>Rotatable star map</li>\n<li>Aperture solar filter</li>\n<li>Tube clamp with handle and camera holder</li>\n<li>Smartphone camera adapter</li>\n<li>Adjustable polar finder scope with optional illumination</li>\n<li>Astronomy PC software Stellarium (via download)</li>\n<li>BRESSER EXOS-2 mount (Non-GOTO)</li>\n<li>Stainless steel tube field tripod with accessory tray</li>\n<li>2 x 4.5kg Counterweights</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download the Bresser Messier Mount &amp; Telescope Manual <a>here</a></p>\n<p><em>SAFETY NOTICE:</em> <span>Never look directly at the Sun through your Binoculars or Telescope - immediate and permanent eye damage may result.

Nebulae, that can only be barely detected in smaller scopes, start to reveal structures within. The excellent Hexafoc focuser boosts a large 2.5\" diameter so that you don't have vignetting in big widefield eyepieces that can occur in smaller focuser barrels.</p>\n<p>The big altitude wheels handle the large heavy optics without issue - and if you decide to use even larger accessories (like a bino-viewer with two eyepieces) then you can move the tube in its tube rings and achieve balance within seconds.

         "<p><strong>This universal 50mm Guide Scope &amp; Finder Scope has a focal length of 220mm and although initialy designed for the Explore Scientific range, its also suitable for use on a wide range of other telescopes. </strong></p>\n<p>This excellent 8x50 Finder Scope has a detachable eyepiece unit and crosshairs with adjustable red illumination for ease of use in the dark. The very precise helical focuser has many connection possibilities such as a 1.25\" / 31.7mm plug-in connector, as well as the T2 camera connection thread (M42x0.75mm) to enable the autoguiding camera required for long exposure astrophotography. It can even be used as a small mini travel telescope.<br>The scope viewfinder also has a very large field of view (FOV) of 6.96 degrees, making it much easier to search for and target objects. The existing scale markers (division =1 degree) of the crosshairs are a good reference for estimating distances and the open center marking also facilitates the precise centering of objects. All the lens surfaces have a multi-coating and guarantee a bright viewfinder image due to the high light transmission values. The adjustable red LED lighting is powered by two LR41 button cells. The main lens and crosshairs can be focused independently, giving you perfect focus for your eyes.<br><em>Compact tracking unit for Auto-guiding:</em><br>One of the main applications for this telescope is auto-guiding. For this purpose, the Guide Scope is inserted into the existing scope shoe of the primary optics and aligned in parallel. If the existing scope shoe is not compatible, a second shoe is also included. A tracking camera can be mounted with the 1.25 inch/31.7mm plug-in connector at the rear of the scope or via T2 threaded connection (M42x0.75mm) - Please note the required back focus for your tracking camera. The focus plane (or back focus) is about 22mm behind the T2 thread. The precision focuser allows you to focus sharply onto the guide star and for easy repetition of the focus point, the focus tube has a white millimeter scale of 0 to 28mm laserd on top.<br><em>Use as a mini travel telescope:</em><br>This Finder / Guide Scope can also be easily used as a mini travel telescope. A magnification of x 8 to x 40 can be achieved with optionally available eyepieces. Almost all eyepieces with an eyepiece focal length of 5 to 26mm and 1.25 inch/31.7mm plug-in connection type are suitable.<br><em>Metal viewfinder holder and viewfinder shoe:</em><br>The base holder of the viewfinder and guide telescope is made entirely of aluminum and forms a stable base.

         "<p><strong>This high resolution deep sky camera incorporates a large 'Sony Exmor IMX428 CMOS' sensor and active cooling and is ideal for telescopes with short and moderate focal lengths.</strong><br>The Explore Scientific 7.1MP Astro camera comes in a modern complete package for the comfortable imaging of a wide range of night sky targets. This easy-to-use camera is ideal for capturing galaxies, star clusters, the moon and even planets with an extremely high sensor sensitivity and very low sensor noise. The high sensitivity enables very short exposure times and the freezing of the air turbulence (seeing) in planetary images. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred to your storage device within seconds.<br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope using the T2 female thread (M42.0.75mm) or the supplied 2\" (50.8mm) plug-in adapter and after installing the drivers and the included Explore Capture recording and editing software, you are ready to start imaging.<br>The Explore Capture pro software included, not only offers the basic functions required for imaging and video capture, but also many helpful special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Functions such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, time lapse recording and much more can be configured individually. This sophisticated software makes your entry into astrophotography much easier and using the automatic default settings you can produce stunning results without any previous knowledge.<br>The Explore Scientific deep sky camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise Sony Exmor IMX428 CMOS sensor which is additionally cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. In contrast to normal DSLR cameras, this guarantees much lower noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots. The images are not only much sharper and more detailed, but also contain more usable signal information. As this camera is cooled, you can carry out your dark and bias frame calibrations at any time. The large-format CMOS sensor with 17.6mm diagonal also allows large image fields and makes framing objects so much easier. <br>The camera has a built-in USB hub with 2 x USB2.0 ports at the rear. Connect your additional auto guider camera or motor focus etc. via a short USB cable and reduce the risk of cable spaghetti and cable breaks. Separate cable connections between your accessories and your computer are no longer necessary. To protect the camera when not in use, a sturdy hard case is also included. <br><em><br></em> <strong>Key Camera Features:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Camera type: ASTRO Camera 7.1MP ATR3CMOS07100KPA</li>\n<li>Colour: Blue</li>\n<li>Material: Aluminium</li>\n<li>Data output: single pictures and video</li>\n<li>Image Sensor: SONY Exmor IMX428 CMOS Color Sensor</li>\n<li>Resolution: 3200x2200</li>\n<li>Binning: 1x1 / 2x2</li>\n<li>Frame rate per second (FBS): 51 / 133</li>\n<li>Physical sensor size in pixels: 3200 x 2200 / 1600 x 1100</li>\n<li>Megapixel: 7.1 MP</li>\n<li>Sensor size: 14.4 x 9.9 mm (1.1 inch)</li>\n<li>Pixel size: 4.5 µm x 4.5 µm</li>\n<li>Bit depth: 12 Bit</li>\n<li>Backfocus: 17,5 mm</li>\n<li>Shutter Type: global shutter</li>\n<li>Internal camera memory: DDR 3 RAM</li>\n<li>Thermoelectric cooling with fan: yes, up to 40°C below ambient temperature</li>\n<li>Adjustable exposure times: 150µs to 60min</li>\n<li>Operating temperature: -10 to +50°C (30-80% RLH)</li>\n<li>Cable length USB 3.0: 150cm</li>\n<li>DC cable length power supply: 200cm</li>\n<li>CNC machined aluminium housing</li>\n<li>Camera connection thread: T2 (M42x0,75mm)</li>\n<li>Filter thread: Yes, 2.0 inch in receptacle</li>\n<li>Camera connection to PC: USB 3.0</li>\n<li>Built-in USB hub with 2 x USB 2.0 ports</li>\n<li>Power supply: Power supply 12 Volt 3,0 Ampere included</li>\n<li>Software: EXPLORE Capture included</li>\n<li>Camera driver and ASCOM driver included</li>\n<li>Operating system: WINDOWS 7, 8 and 10</li>\n<li>PC requirements: CPU Intel Core2 2.8Ghz or higher / 2 GB Ram / USB 3.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weight &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total length 102 mm</li>\n<li>Total width 80 mm</li>\n<li>Total height 80 mm</li>\n<li>Net weight (without access.): 0.53kg</li>\n<li>Net Weight total (incl. accessories): 2.2kg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whats included:<br></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deep Sky Astro Camera 7.1MP</li>\n<li>Telescope adapter T2 thread to 2.0\" (50.8mm)</li>\n<li>USB 3.0 connection cable 150cm</li>\n<li>Power supply 230V/12V3,0A</li>\n<li>Dust cap</li>\n<li>Hard case</li>\n<li>Instruction manual</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<div><span><strong>DOWNLOAD YOUR CAMERA SOFTWARE &amp; MANUAL HERE:</strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Download the Astro Cam ASCOM &amp; Software Drivers <a>here</a></span></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>"

However, in many cases, T2 and T2-ring adapters for connecting telescope focusers to a camera are not the correct focus distance. This is especially important when using correctors, reducers or flatteners in the image train.

         "The Telrad viewfinder is a projection finder that can be installed on any telescope and makes it extremely easy to align the telescope with stars in the night sky.<br>The Telrad viewfinder is a practical alternative to classic optical viewfinders and illuminated red dot viewfinders. You can see the complete starry sky without magnification, and not just a small section as with a normal optical viewfinder. Against the background, three red luminous concentric rings are projected, with apparent diameters of 4 degrees, 2° and 0.5° in the sky. Move the telescope so that the object you are looking for is in the inner ring to make sure your primary scope is aligned with it.<br>The base of the Telrad viewfinder is self-adhesive and can be mounted on most telescopic tubes from about 10cm diameter upwards. The length of the base is about 18cm. This base remains on the telescopic tube while the Telrad viewfinder itself can be removed and attached at any time by means of the quick coupling. The Telrad is powered by two normal AA batteries (these are not included).<br><strong>Details:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Telrad projection finder</li>\n<li>Illuminated rings of 4 degrees, 2° and 0.5° in the sky</li>\n<li>See the complete starry sky without magnification</li>\n<li>Easy installation</li>\n<li>Can be installed on nearly all telescopes</li>\n<li>Base with quick release coupling included</li>\n<li>Powered by two AA batteries (not included)</li>\n<li>Very long battery life because of LED technology</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Weight &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Total length: 180 mm</li>\n<li>Total width: 60 mm</li>\n<li>Total height: 120 mm</li>\n<li>Net weight (without access.): 200g</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ol>\n<li>Telrad viewfinder with projector and battery compartment</li>\n<li>Telrad base with quick-release coupling for the viewfinder</li>\n<li>Adhesive tape for attachment to telescope</li>\n</ol>"

This filter is fast bcoming a must have item for serious Astro-imagers using OSC cameras.<br>The L-eXtreme is a two 7NM narrow bandpass filter which can be used with one-shot color cameras like DSLRs (digital SLR), color CMOS and monochrome CCD cameras. The convenience and cost-effectiveness of this filter allows amateurs to photograph rich emission type nebulas, even in bright, heavily light-polluted skies. The L-eXtreme filter is the best choice for fast optical systems as it isolates the H-Alpha and Oxygen III nebula emission lines so that the contrast and signal-to-noise ratio between these are maximized.<br>L-eXtreme has a multiple anti-reflective coatings on the optical substrate. The L-eXtreme filter uses a precision coating based on ion deposition coating technology. This ensures durability and scratch resistance as well as stability on the CWL (central wavelength), which is not affected by temperature changes. Absolute precision of the coatings as well as maximum values for transmission in the passband and optical density in the off-band range are guaranteed for all filters.<br><em>IMPORTANT WARNING: These nebula filters are NOT designed for observation of the Sun.

This filter is fast bcoming a must have item for serious Astro-imagers using OSC cameras.<br>The L-eXtreme is a two 7NM narrow bandpass filter which can be used with one-shot color cameras like DSLRs (digital SLR), color CMOS and monochrome CCD cameras. The convenience and cost-effectiveness of this filter allows amateurs to photograph rich emission type nebulas, even in bright, heavily light-polluted skies. The L-eXtreme filter is the best choice for fast optical systems as it isolates the H-Alpha and Oxygen III nebula emission lines so that the contrast and signal-to-noise ratio between these are maximized.<br>L-eXtreme has a multiple anti-reflective coatings on the optical substrate. The L-eXtreme filter uses a precision coating based on ion deposition coating technology. This ensures durability and scratch resistance as well as stability on the CWL (central wavelength), which is not affected by temperature changes. Absolute precision of the coatings as well as maximum values for transmission in the passband and optical density in the off-band range are guaranteed for all filters.<br><em>IMPORTANT WARNING: These nebula filters are NOT designed for observation of the Sun.

         "If you already own a DSLR and want to take long exposure deep sky astrophotography then a Star Tracker is a must have item. This mount will automatically compensate for the natural rotation of the earth. The built-in tracking motor rotates the saddle-mounted camera precisely against the earth's rotation and thus the stars remain in pinpoint shape even with long exposures. <br>If you already own a sturdy photo tripod with a video tilt head you can use the photo mount's head directly with the 1/4 inch &amp; 3/8 inch photo thread holes. The pole height (latitude) is then adjusted by the video tilt head.<br>All cameras with 1/4 inch (6.3mm) tripod connection thread and bulb length\" B \"for long exposures are suitable. The Bresser Star Tracker Astronomical Photo Mount PM-100 is designed for a camera &amp; lens of max weight 2kg total to track in polar mode. In Azimut mode a weight up to 5.0kg is possible. <br>Large aperture, wide-angle lenses are ideal for astrophotography and a shot with a wide-angle lens can be exposed for up to several minutes and the stars will remain sharp, allowing you to capture some of the fainter details in night sky targets such as the Milkyway. However the Polar alignment must be extremely accurate for long exposure lengths but thanks to the integrated pole finder tunnel, this is done quickly and easily. After setting up the light and compact Star Tracker Photo Mount, simply set the approximate latitude (pole height) and aim Polaris through the integrated pole finder tunnel. Then mount the camera with the photo lens using the quick-release plate on the supplied ball head - With the ball head, the camera can pointed to any section of the sky.<br>The tracking is carried out by a precise stepper motor, which is controlled by an easy digital display screen.

         "<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>This high resolution and very capable deep sky Astro camera comes with a large Panasonic CMOS sensor and active camera cooling.</strong><br>With the new Explore Scientific Deep Sky Astro camera you get a modern complete package for the comfortable shooting of astro photos and videos. Finally, an easy-to-use camera for capturing galaxies, star clusters, the moon and even planets with high resolution and very low sensor noise. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred within a seconds. Long waiting times are now a thing of the past.<br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope using the T2 female thread (M42.0.75mm) or the supplied 2\" (50.8mm) plug-in adapter and after installing the drivers and the included 'Explore Capture' recording and editing software, you are ready to take your Astro photos to the next level.<br>The Explore Capture Pro software included not only offers the basic functions required for image and video capture, but also many helpful special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Functions such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, time-lapse recording and so much more can be configured separately.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Choose to use the automatic settings to produce absolutely fantastic results without any previous knowledge or simply switch off the automatic settings and adjust the individual professional settings to your own preference - Its up to you.<br>The new Explore Deep Sky Camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise Panasonic CMOS sensor which can also be cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. In contrast to normal DSLR cameras, this guarantees much lower noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots. This results in images that are not only much sharper and more brilliant, but also contain more usable image information.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Through the controlled setting of the desired camera temperature, you can now produce dark frames under reproducible shooting conditions at any time. The large-format CMOS sensor with 21.9mm diagonal also allows large image fields and makes the adjustment and centering of objects considerably easier. <br>The camera has a built-in USB hub with 2 x USB2.0 ports at the rear. Connect your additional Auto-guider camera or motor focus etc. via a short USB cable and reduce the risk of cable spaghetti and cable breaks. Separate cable connections between your accessories and your computer are also no longer necessary. <br></div>\n<div>\n<br><strong>Key Camera Features:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Camera type: ASTRO Camera 16.0MP ATR3CMOS16000KPA </li>\n<li>Data output: single pictures and video </li>\n<li>Image Sensor: Panasonic NM34230PLI CMOS Color Sensor </li>\n<li>Adjustable resolution: 4648x3506 / 2304x1750 / 1536x1168 </li>\n<li>Adjustable binning: 1x1 / 2x2 / 3x3 </li>\n<li>Frame rate per second (FBS): 22.5 / 43 / 48 </li>\n<li>Physical sensor size in pixels: 4648 x 3506 </li>\n<li>Megapixel: 16 MP </li>\n<li>Sensor size: 17.6 x 13.3 mm (4/3 inch) </li>\n<li>Pixel size: 3.8 µm x 3.8 µm </li>\n<li>Bit depth: 12 Bit </li>\n<li>Backfocus: 17,5 mm  </li>\n<li>Shutter Type: rolling shutter</li>\n<li>Internal camera memory: DDR 3 RAM</li>\n<li>Thermoelectric cooling with fan: yes, up to 40°C below ambient temperature </li>\n<li>Adjustable exposure times: 150µs to 60min </li>\n<li>Operating temperature: -10 to +50°C (30-80% RLH) </li>\n<li>Cable length USB 3.0: 150cm </li>\n<li>DC cable length power supply: 200cm </li>\n<li>CNC machined aluminium housing </li>\n<li>Camera diameter: 80mm; length: 102mm </li>\n<li>Camera weight: 0,53 kg </li>\n<li>Camera connection diameter: 2.0 inch ( 50.8mm) </li>\n<li>Camera connection thread: T2 (M42x0,75mm) </li>\n<li>Filter thread: Yes, 2.0 inch in receptacle </li>\n<li>Camera connection to PC: USB 3.0 </li>\n<li>Built-in USB hub with 2 x USB 2.0 ports </li>\n<li>Power supply: Power supply 12 Volt 3,0 Ampere included </li>\n<li>Software: EXPLORE Capture included </li>\n<li>Camera driver and ASCOM driver included</li>\n<li>Operating system: WINDOWS 7, 8 and 10 </li>\n<li>PC requirements: CPU Intel Core2 2.8Ghz or higher / 2 GB Ram / USB 3.0<br></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>General Technical Data:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>One Shot Colour Astro Camera 16.0MP</li>\n<li>Material: Blue - Aluminium Casing</li>\n<li>Dimensions: Length 102mm, Diameter 80mm</li>\n<li>Net Weight: 530g (without Accessories) </li>\n<li>Telescope adapter T2 thread to 2.0\" (50,8mm) </li>\n<li>USB 3.0 connection cable 150cm </li>\n<li>Power supply 230V/12V3,0A (Included) </li>\n<li>Dust cap</li>\n<li>Software CD </li>\n<li>Hard case </li>\n<li>Instruction manual</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div><span><strong>DOWNLOAD YOUR CAMERA SOFTWARE &amp; MANUAL HERE:</strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Download the Astro Cam ASCOM &amp; Software Drivers <a>here</a></span></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The large 85 mm secondary mirror also helps reduce vignetting for maximum optimal illumination of the target. The excellent 2,5\" Hexafoc focuser also helps reduce vignetting due to its large diameter and makes focussing a joy - the smoothness and shifting-free operation sets a new standard in this price class.<br><em>BRESSER EXOS-2 Equatorial Mount:</em><br>The Bresser EXOS-2 is a rugged German Equatorial Mount offering high rigidity and precision tracking for visual observation as well as astrophotography. The tripod is extremely sturdy and designed to suppress vibrations very well. As with all the Bressier Messier range, this mount is built to extremely high standards and comes with an illuminated polar finder scope and precise graduated circles for more accuracy and ease of use during polar alignement. - If you wish at a later stage to upgrade the mount to a full computerised GOTO system, a powered two axis GOTO-Kit is available as an optional extra.

Nebulae, that can only be barely detected in smaller scopes, start to reveal structures within. The excellent Hexafoc focuser boosts a large 2.5\" diameter so that you don't have vignetting in big widefield eyepieces that can occur in smaller focuser barrels.</p>\n<p>The big altitude wheels handle the large heavy optics without issue - and if you decide to use even larger accessories (like a bino-viewer with two eyepieces) then you can move the tube in its tube rings and achieve balance within seconds.

         "<p><strong>The Explore Scientific EXOS2-GT PMC-8 GOTO mount has a completely new Goto controller developed according to strict US military standards and functions completely without the use of a hand controller. It consists of a robust Wifi controller unit, which provides all the necessary interfaces to control the mount using a phone app or computer.</strong> <br>The EXOS2-GT PMC-8 mount includes Nema-11 stepper motors which are connected directly to the unit via a cable and an ST-4 compatible autoguider interface is also available. The digital controller also supports a fine microstep operation to ensure extremely precise tracking. The power supply is via 12 volt direct current and the current consumption is a maximum of 1.6 amps at full load. For Wifi control of the mount, tablets, notebooks or desktop PC can be used, that have at least a 7\" (17.5cm) display, a functioning Wifi and an operating system using Windows, 8.1, 10, or iOS or Android 4.4 and higher. <br>The specially developed APP ExploreStars offers a very convenient graphical user interface which also makes controlling the mount and navigating the sky a pleasure. Once initiated, the currently available alignment stars for initial alignment as well as the celestial objects of the database are displayed as a star map with additional and useful text information. The heart of the controller unit consists of a completely self-sufficient 2-channel multi-processor with 8 CPUs and a Wifi Ethernet 10/100 adapter and an IP function, which allows completely remote operation from anywhere via a web browser, ASCOM, and APP or if you prefer not to use the wireless option, you can even connect directly to the mount using a serial port cable.

         "<p><strong>This universal 50mm Guide Scope &amp; Finder Scope has a focal length of 220mm and although initialy designed for the Explore Scientific range, its also suitable for use on a wide range of other telescopes. </strong></p>\n<p>This excellent 8x50 Finder Scope has a detachable eyepiece unit and crosshairs with adjustable red illumination for ease of use in the dark. The very precise helical focuser has many connection possibilities such as a 1.25\" / 31.7mm plug-in connector, as well as the T2 camera connection thread (M42x0.75mm) to enable the autoguiding camera required for long exposure astrophotography. It can even be used as a small mini travel telescope.<br>The scope viewfinder also has a very large field of view (FOV) of 6.96 degrees, making it much easier to search for and target objects. The existing scale markers (division =1 degree) of the crosshairs are a good reference for estimating distances and the open center marking also facilitates the precise centering of objects. All the lens surfaces have a multi-coating and guarantee a bright viewfinder image due to the high light transmission values. The adjustable red LED lighting is powered by two LR41 button cells. The main lens and crosshairs can be focused independently, giving you perfect focus for your eyes.<br><em>Compact tracking unit for Auto-guiding:</em><br>One of the main applications for this telescope is auto-guiding. For this purpose, the Guide Scope is inserted into the existing scope shoe of the primary optics and aligned in parallel. If the existing scope shoe is not compatible, a second shoe is also included. A tracking camera can be mounted with the 1.25 inch/31.7mm plug-in connector at the rear of the scope or via T2 threaded connection (M42x0.75mm) - Please note the required back focus for your tracking camera. The focus plane (or back focus) is about 22mm behind the T2 thread. The precision focuser allows you to focus sharply onto the guide star and for easy repetition of the focus point, the focus tube has a white millimeter scale of 0 to 28mm laserd on top.<br><em>Use as a mini travel telescope:</em><br>This Finder / Guide Scope can also be easily used as a mini travel telescope. A magnification of x 8 to x 40 can be achieved with optionally available eyepieces. Almost all eyepieces with an eyepiece focal length of 5 to 26mm and 1.25 inch/31.7mm plug-in connection type are suitable.<br><em>Metal viewfinder holder and viewfinder shoe:</em><br>The base holder of the viewfinder and guide telescope is made entirely of aluminum and forms a stable base. If the existing viewfinder shoe is not compatible, a suitable viewfinder shoe which is included can be attached to the OTA using 4 x M5 screws. The bore distances of the viewfinder shoe on the longitudinal and transverse axis are 31.7mm. All the adjustment and clamping screws have plastic tips that effectively prevent scratching of the viewfinder housing and the viewfinder holder.<br><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>8 x 50 Finder / Guide Scope</li>\n<li>Can also be used as a mini travel telescope</li>\n<li>Perfect image sharpness</li>\n<li>FMC Multi-coated Lens Surfaces</li>\n<li>Lens focal length: 220mm</li>\n<li>Maximum permissible camera weight: 550g</li>\n<li>Removable eyepiece/crosshair unit</li>\n<li>Camera connection via 1.25 inch / 31.7mm plug-in connector or T2 thread</li>\n<li>T2 thread: M42 x 0.75mm</li>\n<li>Precise helical focuser for focusing the field of view</li>\n<li>Setting distance of the helical focuser: 28mm</li>\n<li>Close focusing limit: 3m</li>\n<li>Laser-engraved millimeter scale from 0 to 28mm on the focuser</li>\n<li>Sharpness plane (back focus) is approx. 22mm behind the T2 thread</li>\n<li>Separate focus of the crosshairs on the eyepiece</li>\n<li>Very large field of view FOV of 6.96 degrees</li>\n<li>With adjustable red crosshair lighting</li>\n<li>Scale markings of the crosshairs with 1.0 degree pitch</li>\n<li>Power supply: Two LR41 button cells</li>\n<li>Ring clamping made of brass and 3 clamping screws on the 1.25 inch plug-in connection</li>\n<li>With optional eyepieces, magnifications from 8x to 40x can be achieved</li>\n<li>Almost all eyepieces with 1.25 inch / 31.7mm plug-in connection are suitable</li>\n<li>Holder of the viewfinder telescope is made entirely of aluminum</li>\n<li>Viewfinder mount with 6 large adjustment screws with non-slip ring</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Weight &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Total length: 250 mm</li>\n<li>Total width: 140 mm</li>\n<li>Total height: 80 mm</li>\n<li>Total net weight (incl. accessories): 800g</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ol>\n<li>8 x 50 Finder / Guide Scope</li>\n<li>Eyepiece unit with crosshairs - Crosshair lighting incl. batteries</li>\n<li>Viewfinder holder with viewfinder shoe</li>\n<li>Operating instructions</li>\n</ol>",

         "<p><strong>This high resolution deep sky camera incorporates a large 'Sony Exmor IMX428 CMOS' sensor and active cooling and is ideal for telescopes with short and moderate focal lengths.</strong><br>The Explore Scientific 7.1MP Astro camera comes in a modern complete package for the comfortable imaging of a wide range of night sky targets. This easy-to-use camera is ideal for capturing galaxies, star clusters, the moon and even planets with an extremely high sensor sensitivity and very low sensor noise. The high sensitivity enables very short exposure times and the freezing of the air turbulence (seeing) in planetary images. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred to your storage device within seconds.<br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope using the T2 female thread (M42.0.75mm) or the supplied 2\" (50.8mm) plug-in adapter and after installing the drivers and the included Explore Capture recording and editing software, you are ready to start imaging.<br>The Explore Capture pro software included, not only offers the basic functions required for imaging and video capture, but also many helpful special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Functions such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, time lapse recording and much more can be configured individually. This sophisticated software makes your entry into astrophotography much easier and using the automatic default settings you can produce stunning results without any previous knowledge.<br>The Explore Scientific deep sky camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise Sony Exmor IMX428 CMOS sensor which is additionally cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. In contrast to normal DSLR cameras, this guarantees much lower noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots. The images are not only much sharper and more detailed, but also contain more usable signal information. As this camera is cooled, you can carry out your dark and bias frame calibrations at any time. The large-format CMOS sensor with 17.6mm diagonal also allows large image fields and makes framing objects so much easier. <br>The camera has a built-in USB hub with 2 x USB2.0 ports at the rear.

This set also comes with a SC to T2 thread adapter.<br>In astrophotography, most cameras are connected to a telescope via a T2 thread (M42x0.75), which is the most popular international standard. However, in many cases, T2 and T2-ring adapters for connecting telescope focusers to a camera are not the correct focus distance. This is especially important when using correctors, reducers or flatteners in the image train. This extension tube set, which consists of 5mm, 7.5mm, 10mm, 15mm and 30mm tubes, will allow you to obtain almost any distance using various combinations. Each tube has a T2 interior thread on one side and a T2 exterior thread on the other side.<br>Most telescopes either include a T2 thread adapter, or the eyepiece can be used with a simple T2 thread adapter with a 2\" plug-in.<br>However, Maksutov-Cassegrain, Schmidt-Cassegrain, ACF or Ritchey Chrétien telescopes may use a so-called SC thread.

Against the background, three red luminous concentric rings are projected, with apparent diameters of 4 degrees, 2° and 0.5° in the sky. Move the telescope so that the object you are looking for is in the inner ring to make sure your primary scope is aligned with it.<br>The base of the Telrad viewfinder is self-adhesive and can be mounted on most telescopic tubes from about 10cm diameter upwards. The length of the base is about 18cm. This base remains on the telescopic tube while the Telrad viewfinder itself can be removed and attached at any time by means of the quick coupling.

The dark red structures will be shown even darker, so this is also the perfect filter for watching the big red Flecks on the gas planet Jupiter.

One solution is to purchase a Mono camera but this can be expensive and might also require the purchase of several types of narrowband filters and a filter wheel.<br>These filters open up a whole new opportunity for fast newtonian telescopes, double-lens ED refractors or even achromats, allowing for extremely detailed and high class astronomical images even from heavy light polluted cities as it blocks out all artificial light pollution sources as it is a Tri-bandpass filter, only allowing for the wavelengths of O-III, H-Beta &amp; H-Alpha.<br>L-eNhance provides an economical and practical solution for amateurs using DSLR or color CMOS and monochrome CCD cameras. The convenience and cost-effectiveness of this filter allows amateurs to take detailed astronomical images, even in bright, heavily light-polluted areas thanks to its maximum transmission lines of up to 90%. The narrow bandpass for the wavelengths of O-III, H-Beta and H-Alpha really help control the impact from light polluted skies.<br>L-eNhance has a multiple anti-reflective coating on the optical substrate which uses a precision coating based on ion deposition coating technology. This ensures durability and scratch resistance as well as stability on the CWL (central wavelength), which is not affected by temperature changes.<br><em>IMPORTANT WARNING: These nebula filters are NOT designed for observation of the Sun.

         "If you already own a DSLR and want to take long exposure deep sky astrophotography then a Star Tracker is a must have item. This mount will automatically compensate for the natural rotation of the earth. The built-in tracking motor rotates the saddle-mounted camera precisely against the earth's rotation and thus the stars remain in pinpoint shape even with long exposures. <br>If you already own a sturdy photo tripod with a video tilt head you can use the photo mount's head directly with the 1/4 inch &amp; 3/8 inch photo thread holes. The pole height (latitude) is then adjusted by the video tilt head.<br>All cameras with 1/4 inch (6.3mm) tripod connection thread and bulb length\" B \"for long exposures are suitable. The Bresser Star Tracker Astronomical Photo Mount PM-100 is designed for a camera &amp; lens of max weight 2kg total to track in polar mode. In Azimut mode a weight up to 5.0kg is possible. <br>Large aperture, wide-angle lenses are ideal for astrophotography and a shot with a wide-angle lens can be exposed for up to several minutes and the stars will remain sharp, allowing you to capture some of the fainter details in night sky targets such as the Milkyway. However the Polar alignment must be extremely accurate for long exposure lengths but thanks to the integrated pole finder tunnel, this is done quickly and easily. After setting up the light and compact Star Tracker Photo Mount, simply set the approximate latitude (pole height) and aim Polaris through the integrated pole finder tunnel. Then mount the camera with the photo lens using the quick-release plate on the supplied ball head - With the ball head, the camera can pointed to any section of the sky.<br>The tracking is carried out by a precise stepper motor, which is controlled by an easy digital display screen. Low power consumption allows up to 20 hours of operation with just one battery charge or simply use the micro USB port for an unlimited power supply.<br><strong>Star Tracker Features:</strong> <br><ul>\n<li>Equatorial Star Tracker Photo-Mount</li>\n<li>Automatic sidereal tracking against the Earth rotation</li>\n<li>Different tracking speed setting possible</li>\n<li>Suitable for northern and southern hemisphere</li>\n<li>Time lapse: from 15 minutes to 48 hours</li>\n<li>Ball head with quick release saddle plate</li>\n<li>and 1/4\" Photo thread for Camera mounting</li>\n<li>Photo-Mount with 1/4\" threaded bolt for ball head mounting</li>\n<li>Additional quick release coupling for ball head removal</li>\n<li>High precision stepper motor with helical gear for accurate tracking</li>\n<li>Clear LCD screen and easy setup menu</li>\n<li>Battery operation 4 x AA batteries or micro USB (optional acc.)</li>\n<li>Battery life: up to 20 hours</li>\n<li>Weight Photo-Mont: 0.63kg</li>\n<li>Load capacity of Photo-Mount: up to 2.0kg/5.0kg (EQ/AZ)</li>\n<li>Optional Accessory: Polar-wedge, Tripod and carry-case, optical pole finder scope with illumination unit</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Weights &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Total length: 86 mm</li>\n<li>Total width: 64 mm</li>\n<li>Total height: 65 mm</li>\n<li>Net weight (without access.): 630g</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ol>\n<li>Star Tracker astronomical Photo-Mount <em>(Tripod &amp; Wedge not included)</em>\n</li>\n<li>Ball head with quick release saddle plate</li>\n<li>User manual</li>\n</ol>\nDownload the Star Tracker Manual <a>Here</a>",

It consists of a robust Wifi controller unit, which provides all the necessary interfaces to control the mount using a phone app or computer.</strong> <br>The EXOS2-GT PMC-8 mount includes Nema-11 stepper motors which are connected directly to the unit via a cable and an ST-4 compatible autoguider interface is also available. The digital controller also supports a fine microstep operation to ensure extremely precise tracking. The power supply is via 12 volt direct current and the current consumption is a maximum of 1.6 amps at full load. For Wifi control of the mount, tablets, notebooks or desktop PC can be used, that have at least a 7\" (17.5cm) display, a functioning Wifi and an operating system using Windows, 8.1, 10, or iOS or Android 4.4 and higher. <br>The specially developed APP ExploreStars offers a very convenient graphical user interface which also makes controlling the mount and navigating the sky a pleasure. Once initiated, the currently available alignment stars for initial alignment as well as the celestial objects of the database are displayed as a star map with additional and useful text information. The heart of the controller unit consists of a completely self-sufficient 2-channel multi-processor with 8 CPUs and a Wifi Ethernet 10/100 adapter and an IP function, which allows completely remote operation from anywhere via a web browser, ASCOM, and APP or if you prefer not to use the wireless option, you can even connect directly to the mount using a serial port cable.

The very precise helical focuser has many connection possibilities such as a 1.25\" / 31.7mm plug-in connector, as well as the T2 camera connection thread (M42x0.75mm) to enable the autoguiding camera required for long exposure astrophotography. It can even be used as a small mini travel telescope.<br>The scope viewfinder also has a very large field of view (FOV) of 6.96 degrees, making it much easier to search for and target objects. The existing scale markers (division =1 degree) of the crosshairs are a good reference for estimating distances and the open center marking also facilitates the precise centering of objects. All the lens surfaces have a multi-coating and guarantee a bright viewfinder image due to the high light transmission values. The adjustable red LED lighting is powered by two LR41 button cells. The main lens and crosshairs can be focused independently, giving you perfect focus for your eyes.<br><em>Compact tracking unit for Auto-guiding:</em><br>One of the main applications for this telescope is auto-guiding. For this purpose, the Guide Scope is inserted into the existing scope shoe of the primary optics and aligned in parallel. If the existing scope shoe is not compatible, a second shoe is also included. A tracking camera can be mounted with the 1.25 inch/31.7mm plug-in connector at the rear of the scope or via T2 threaded connection (M42x0.75mm) - Please note the required back focus for your tracking camera. The focus plane (or back focus) is about 22mm behind the T2 thread. The precision focuser allows you to focus sharply onto the guide star and for easy repetition of the focus point, the focus tube has a white millimeter scale of 0 to 28mm laserd on top.<br><em>Use as a mini travel telescope:</em><br>This\\xa0Finder /\\xa0Guide Scope can also be easily used as a mini travel telescope.

This easy-to-use camera is ideal for capturing galaxies, star clusters, the moon and even planets with an extremely high sensor sensitivity and very low sensor noise. The high sensitivity enables very short exposure times and the freezing of the air turbulence (seeing) in planetary images. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred to your storage device within seconds.<br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope using the T2 female thread (M42.0.75mm) or the supplied 2\" (50.8mm) plug-in adapter and after installing the drivers and the included Explore Capture recording and editing software, you are ready to start imaging.<br>The Explore Capture pro software included, not only offers the basic functions required for imaging and video capture, but also many helpful special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Functions such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, time lapse recording and much more can be configured individually. This sophisticated software makes your entry into astrophotography much easier and using the automatic default settings you can produce stunning results without any previous knowledge.<br>The Explore Scientific deep sky camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise Sony Exmor IMX428 CMOS sensor which is additionally cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. In contrast to normal DSLR cameras, this guarantees much lower noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots. The images are not only much sharper and more detailed, but also contain more usable signal information. As this camera is cooled, you can carry out your dark and bias frame calibrations at any time. The large-format CMOS sensor with 17.6mm diagonal also allows large image fields and makes framing objects so much easier. <br>The camera has a built-in USB hub with 2 x USB2.0 ports at the rear. Connect your additional auto guider camera or motor focus etc. via a short USB cable and reduce the risk of cable spaghetti and cable breaks. Separate cable connections between your accessories and your computer are no longer necessary. To protect the camera when not in use, a sturdy hard case is also included. <br><em><br></em> <strong>Key Camera Features:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Camera type: ASTRO Camera 7.1MP ATR3CMOS07100KPA</li>\\n<li>Colour: Blue</li>\\n<li>Material: Aluminium</li>\\n<li>Data output: single pictures and video</li>\\n<li>Image Sensor: SONY Exmor IMX428 CMOS Color Sensor</li>\\n<li>Resolution: 3200x2200</li>\\n<li>Binning: 1x1 / 2x2</li>\\n<li>Frame rate per second (FBS): 51 / 133</li>\\n<li>Physical sensor size in pixels: 3200 x 2200 / 1600 x 1100</li>\\n<li>Megapixel: 7.1 MP</li>\\n<li>Sensor size: 14.4 x 9.9 mm (1.1 inch)</li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 4.5 µm x 4.5 µm</li>\\n<li>Bit depth: 12 Bit</li>\\n<li>Backfocus: 17,5 mm</li>\\n<li>Shutter Type: global shutter</li>\\n<li>Internal camera memory: DDR 3 RAM</li>\\n<li>Thermoelectric cooling with fan: yes, up to 40°C below ambient temperature</li>\\n<li>Adjustable exposure times: 150µs to 60min</li>\\n<li>Operating temperature: -10 to +50°C (30-80% RLH)</li>\\n<li>Cable length USB 3.0: 150cm</li>\\n<li>DC cable length power supply: 200cm</li>\\n<li>CNC machined aluminium housing</li>\\n<li>Camera connection thread: T2 (M42x0,75mm)</li>\\n<li>Filter thread: Yes, 2.0 inch in receptacle</li>\\n<li>Camera connection to PC: USB 3.0</li>\\n<li>Built-in USB hub with 2 x USB 2.0 ports</li>\\n<li>Power supply: Power supply 12 Volt 3,0 Ampere included</li>\\n<li>Software: EXPLORE Capture included</li>\\n<li>Camera driver and ASCOM driver included</li>\\n<li>Operating system: WINDOWS 7, 8 and 10</li>\\n<li>PC requirements: CPU Intel Core2 2.8Ghz or higher / 2 GB Ram / USB 3.0</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Weight &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Total length 102 mm</li>\\n<li>Total width 80 mm</li>\\n<li>Total height 80 mm</li>\\n<li>Net weight (without access.): 0.53kg</li>\\n<li>Net Weight total (incl. accessories): 2.2kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Whats included:<br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Deep Sky Astro Camera 7.1MP</li>\\n<li>Telescope adapter T2 thread to 2.0\" (50.8mm)</li>\\n<li>USB 3.0 connection cable 150cm</li>\\n<li>Power supply 230V/12V3,0A</li>\\n<li>Dust cap</li>\\n<li>Hard case</li>\\n<li>Instruction manual</li>\\n</ol>\\n<div>\\n<div><span><strong>DOWNLOAD YOUR CAMERA SOFTWARE &amp; MANUAL HERE:</strong></span></div>\\n<div>\\n<ol>\\n<li><span>Download the Astro Cam ASCOM &amp; Software Drivers\\xa0<a>here</a></span></li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n</div>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000021-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 2420.94, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ExploreScientificAstroCam7MP_1.jpg?v=1632229719', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

This set also comes with a SC to T2 thread adapter.<br>In astrophotography, most cameras are connected to a telescope via a T2 thread (M42x0.75), which is the most popular international standard. However, in many cases, T2 and T2-ring adapters for connecting telescope focusers to a camera are not the correct focus distance. This is especially important when using correctors, reducers or flatteners in the image train. This extension tube set, which consists of 5mm, 7.5mm, 10mm, 15mm and 30mm tubes, will allow you to obtain almost any distance using various combinations.

One solution is to purchase a Mono camera but this can be expensive and might also require the purchase of several types of narrowband filters and a filter wheel.</span><br>These filters open up a whole new opportunity for fast newtonian telescopes, double-lens ED refractors or even achromats, allowing for extremely detailed and high class astronomical images even from heavy light polluted cities as it blocks out all artificial light pollution sources as it is a dual narrow bandpass filter, only allowing for the wavelengths of O-III and H-Alpha. This filter is fast bcoming a must have item for serious Astro-imagers using OSC cameras.<br>The L-eXtreme is a two 7NM narrow bandpass filter which can be used with one-shot color cameras like DSLRs (digital SLR), color CMOS and monochrome CCD cameras. The convenience and cost-effectiveness of this filter allows amateurs to photograph rich emission type nebulas, even in bright, heavily light-polluted skies. The L-eXtreme filter is the best choice for fast optical systems as it isolates the H-Alpha and Oxygen III nebula emission lines so that the contrast and signal-to-noise ratio between these are maximized.<br>L-eXtreme has a multiple anti-reflective coatings on the optical substrate. The L-eXtreme filter uses a precision coating based on ion deposition coating technology. This ensures durability and scratch resistance as well as stability on the CWL (central wavelength), which is not affected by temperature changes. Absolute precision of the coatings as well as maximum values for transmission in the passband and optical density in the off-band range are guaranteed for all filters.<br><em>IMPORTANT WARNING: These nebula filters are NOT designed for observation of the Sun.

One solution is to purchase a Mono camera but this can be expensive and might also require the purchase of several types of narrowband filters and a filter wheel.<br>L-Pro is a multi-bandpass filter which offers much better color balance by maximizing the transmission band. The balanced transmission allows astrophotos to be taken with minimal color cast to broadband emission objects such as galaxies, reflection nebulae and globular star clusters. L-Pro remains the best choice for viewing or photographing broadband targets in light polluted areas.<br>L-Pro (L-Professional) filter is designed to improve the visibility of various deepsky objects by selectively reducing the transmission of wavelengths of light pollutants, specifically those produced by artificial lights such as mercury vapor lamps, both high &amp; low pressure sodium vapor lights and the unwanted natural light caused by neutral oxygen emission in our atmosphere (i.e. skyglow). Together with the highly transparent main emission lines at OIII (496nm and 500nm), H-beta (486nm), NII (654nm and 658nm), H-alpha (656nm) as well as SII (672nm), the filter is suitable for enhancing the contrast and details for both visual and photograghic purpose at sub-rural areas with heavy light pollution.<br>L-Pro has a multiple anti-reflective coating on the optical substrate and uses a precision coating based on ion deposition coating technology. This ensures durability and scratch resistance as well as stability on the CWL (central wavelength), which is not affected by temperature changes.<br><em>IMPORTANT WARNING: These nebula filters are NOT designed for observation of the Sun.

This mount will automatically compensate for the natural rotation of the earth. The built-in tracking motor rotates the saddle-mounted camera precisely against the earth\\'s rotation and thus the stars remain in pinpoint shape even with long exposures. <br>If you already own a sturdy photo tripod with a video tilt head you can use the photo mount\\'s head directly with the 1/4 inch &amp; 3/8 inch photo thread holes. The pole height (latitude) is then adjusted by the video tilt head.<br>All cameras with 1/4 inch (6.3mm) tripod connection thread and bulb length\" B \"for long exposures are suitable. The Bresser Star Tracker Astronomical Photo Mount PM-100 is designed for a camera &amp; lens of max weight 2kg total to track in polar mode. In Azimut mode a weight up to 5.0kg is possible. <br>Large aperture, wide-angle lenses are ideal for astrophotography and a shot with a wide-angle lens can be exposed for up to several minutes and the stars will remain sharp, allowing you to capture some of the fainter details in night sky targets such as the Milkyway. However the Polar alignment must be extremely accurate for long exposure lengths but thanks to the integrated pole finder tunnel, this is done quickly and easily. After setting up the light and compact Star Tracker Photo Mount, simply set the approximate latitude (pole height) and aim Polaris through the integrated pole finder tunnel. Then mount the camera with the photo lens using the quick-release plate on the supplied ball head - With the ball head, the camera can pointed to any section of the sky.<br>The tracking is carried out by a precise stepper motor, which is controlled by an easy digital display screen. Low power consumption allows up to 20 hours of operation with just one battery charge or simply use the micro USB port for an unlimited power supply.<br><strong>Star Tracker Features:</strong> <br><ul>\\n<li>Equatorial Star Tracker Photo-Mount</li>\\n<li>Automatic sidereal tracking against the Earth rotation</li>\\n<li>Different tracking speed setting possible</li>\\n<li>Suitable for northern and southern hemisphere</li>\\n<li>Time lapse: from 15 minutes to 48 hours</li>\\n<li>Ball head with quick release saddle plate</li>\\n<li>and 1/4\" Photo thread for Camera mounting</li>\\n<li>Photo-Mount with 1/4\" threaded bolt for ball head mounting</li>\\n<li>Additional quick release coupling for ball head removal</li>\\n<li>High precision stepper motor with helical gear for accurate tracking</li>\\n<li>Clear LCD screen and easy setup menu</li>\\n<li>Battery operation 4 x AA batteries or micro USB (optional acc.)</li>\\n<li>Battery life: up to 20 hours</li>\\n<li>Weight Photo-Mont: 0.63kg</li>\\n<li>Load capacity of Photo-Mount: up to 2.0kg/5.0kg (EQ/AZ)</li>\\n<li>Optional Accessory: Polar-wedge, Tripod and carry-case, optical pole finder scope with illumination unit</li>\\n</ul>\\n<strong>Weights &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br><ul>\\n<li>Total length: 86 mm</li>\\n<li>Total width: 64 mm</li>\\n<li>Total height: 65 mm</li>\\n<li>Net weight (without access.): 630g</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ol>\\n<li>Star Tracker astronomical Photo-Mount\\xa0<em>(Tripod &amp; Wedge not included)</em>\\n</li>\\n<li>Ball head with quick release saddle plate</li>\\n<li>User manual</li>\\n</ol>\\nDownload the Star Tracker Manual <a>Here</a>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000044-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 404.17, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/BresserStarTrackerMount_5.jpg?v=1631736206', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The color sensor with a diagonal of approx. 16 mm can be used on almost any telescope.</strong></div>\\n\\n\\n<div>Due to the square shape, the corrected image field of the telescope is optimally used which even allows many telescopes without a corrector to be used. One of the outstanding features of the ASI 533MC Pro however is the sensational light sensitivity and the QE of 80%. Thanks to the back illumination technology and the very low amplifier glow, this camera is very well suited for all astronomical applications - Particularly for deep sky astrophotography.<br><strong>Main features at a glance:</strong><br><ol>\\n<li>USB 3.0 for a quick download - can also be operated with USB 2.0 - DDR3 memory buffer for stable data transfer with USB2.0 - this minimizes amplifier glow.</li>\\n<li>Powerful Peltier cooling up to -35 °C below ambient.</li>\\n<li>One of Sony's most light-sensitive CMOS sensors</li>\\n<li>High resolution through 3.76 μm pixels - ideal for fast and sharp telescopes, such as APO's, Hyperstar, Celestron Faststar, fast Newtonian telescopes.</li>\\n<li>Includes AR clear glass filter - full passage even in infrared.

By up-regulating the GAIN (comparable to the ISO setting for digital DSLR cameras), you can reduce the exposure times to less than 30 seconds - This helps to reduce the problems associated with seeing conditions and tracking errors.<br><em><br>For the Moon and Planetary images</em>, extremely short exposure times are also possible due to camera's high sensitivity. Due to the high resolution of the sensor, many details can be imaged a shorter focal length - Video capture is also possible.<br><em>Important: external power supply required:</em><br>This camera requires 1 amp minimum (even during uncooled operation), which is a problem for USB sockets on computers, because they are only designed for 900 mA, i.e. 0.9 Amps, therefore a 12V power supply is required to use this camera (sold separately).<br><strong>Camera Spec:</strong><br><ul>\\n<li>Sensor: Sony IMX533MC</li>\\n<li>Diagonal: 15.97mm</li>\\n<li>Resolution: 9 Mega Pixel 3008*3008</li>\\n<li>Pixel Size: 3.76μm</li>\\n<li>Max FPS at full resolution: 20fps</li>\\n<li>Bayer Pattern: RGGB</li>\\n<li>Shutter: Rolling shutter</li>\\n<li>Exposure Range: 32μs-2000s</li>\\n<li>ROI: Supported</li>\\n<li>Read Noise: 1.0-3.8e</li>\\n<li>QE peak: TBD</li>\\n<li>Full well: 50000e</li>\\n<li>ADC:14bit</li>\\n<li>DDRIII Buffer: 256MB</li>\\n<li>Non-volatile memory/On camera storage: Build-in total 192K byte user-accessible space(image size up to 480 X 320)</li>\\n<li>Interface: USB3.0/USB2.0</li>\\n<li>Interface: USB3.0/USB2.0</li>\\n<li>Adaptor: M42X0.75</li>\\n<li>Protect window: D32-2-AR</li>\\n<li>Dimensions: 78mm Diameter</li>\\n<li>Weight: 470g</li>\\n<li>Back Focus Distance: 17.5mm</li>\\n<li>Cooling: Regulated Two Stage TEC</li>\\n<li>Delta T: 35°C-35°C below ambient</li>\\n<li>Camera Power consumption: 650mA at 5V</li>\\n<li>Cooler Power consumption: 12V at 3A Max</li>\\n<li>Working Temperature: -5°C - 45°C</li>\\n<li>Storage Temperature: -20°C - 60°C</li>\\n<li>Working Relative Humidity: 20% - 80%</li>\\n<li>Storage Relative Humidity: 20% - 95%</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Max FPS at full resolution: 14Bit ADC</em><br><ul>\\n<li>3008 × 3008 19.88fps</li>\\n<li>1920 × 1080 54.11fps</li>\\n<li>1280 × 720 79.74fps</li>\\n<li>640 × 480 116.55ps</li>\\n<li>320 × 240 216.45fps</li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Download the ASI 533MC-P Manual <a>here</a></p>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>\\n\", 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000062-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 1407.99, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ASI533MCP_4.jpg?v=1632227494', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

This means that even with longer exposure times, the stars no longer burn out and you get a much better dynamic range in your images.</strong><br>One of the outstanding features of the ASI 2600MC Pro however is the sensational light sensitivity and the QE of 80%. Thanks to the back illumination technology and the very low amplifier glow, this camera is very well suited for all astronomical applications - Particularly for deep sky astrophotography.<br>The camera has a 26MP sensor with a small pixel size of 3.76um, yet it accommodates an impressively large well depth of 50 ke-. As one of the few CMOS astronomy cameras with 16-bit ADC on the market, ASI2600MC Pro was developed with the optimal characteristics for astrophotography in mind. This 16bit ADC is not a CCD 16bit ADC, it can really achieve a dynamic range output of 14 stop, which will significantly improve the image sharpness and contrast, and also create smoother and more natural colour transitions.<br>The ASI2600MC Pro also comes with the polyamide heating element that can avoid any condensation problems on the camera sensor. The anti-dew heater, heats up the protective screen slightly to avoid condensation problems. The power of the anti-dew heater is about 5W. It can be switched on and off in the software to save electricity.<br><strong>Camera Spec:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Sensor: SONY IMX571 CMOS</li>\\n<li>Diagonal: 28.3mm</li>\\n<li>Image area: 23.5 x 17.5mm</li>\\n<li>Resolution: 26 Mega Pixel 6248 x 4176</li>\\n<li>Pixel Size: 3.76μm</li>\\n<li>Bayer Pattern: RGGB</li>\\n<li>Shutter:Rolling shutter</li>\\n<li>Exposure Range: 32μs-2000s</li>\\n<li>ROI: Supported</li>\\n<li>Read Noise: 1.0-3.3e</li>\\n<li>QE peak: over 80%</li>\\n<li>Full well: 50000e</li>\\n<li>ADC:16bit</li>\\n<li>DDRIII Buffer: 256MB</li>\\n<li>Non-volatile memory/On camera storage: Build-in total 192K byte user-accessible space(image size up to 480X320)</li>\\n<li>Interface: USB3.0/USB2.0</li>\\n<li>Interface: USB3.0/USB2.0</li>\\n<li>Adaptor: M42X0.75</li>\\n<li>Protect window: D60-2 IR Cut</li>\\n<li>Dimensions: 90mm Diameter</li>\\n<li>Weight: 700g</li>\\n<li>Back Focus Distance: 17.5mm</li>\\n<li>Cooling: Regulated Two Stage TEC</li>\\n<li>Delta T: 35°C below ambient</li>\\n<li>Camera Power consumption: 1.15A at 5V</li>\\n<li>Cooler Power consumption: 12V at 3A Max</li>\\n<li>Working Temperature: -5°C - 50°C</li>\\n<li>Storage Temperature: -10°C - 60°C</li>\\n<li>Working Relative Humidity: 0% - 80%</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Max FPS at full resolution: 16Bit ADC</em><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>6248 × 4176 3.51fps</li>\\n<li>4096 × 3072 4.75fps</li>\\n<li>4096 × 2160 6.71fps</li>\\n<li>3840 × 2160 6.71fps</li>\\n<li>1920 × 1080 13.13fps</li>\\n<li>1280 × 720 19.29fps</li>\\n<li>640 × 480 28.06fps</li>\\n<li>320 × 240 51.44fps</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Download the ASI 2600MC-P Manual <a>here</a></p>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000064-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 2623.52, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ASI2600MC-P_4.jpg?v=1632229435', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

This means that even with longer exposure times, the stars no longer burn out and you get a much better dynamic range in your images.</strong></p>\\n<div>One of the outstanding features of the ASI 2600MM Pro however is the sensational light sensitivity and the QE of 91%. Thanks to the back illumination technology and the very low amplifier glow, this camera is very well suited for all astronomical applications - Particularly for deep sky astrophotography.<br>The camera has a 26MP sensor with a small pixel size of 3.76um, yet it accommodates an impressively large well depth of 50 ke-. As one of the few CMOS astronomy cameras with 16-bit ADC on the market, ASI2600MM Pro was developed with the optimal characteristics for astrophotography in mind. This 16bit ADC is not a CCD 16bit ADC, it can really achieve a dynamic range output of 14 stop, which will significantly improve the image sharpness and contrast, and also create smoother and more natural colour transitions.<br>The ASI2600MM Pro also comes with the polyamide heating element that can avoid any condensation problems on the camera sensor. The anti-dew heater, heats up the protective screen slightly to avoid condensation problems. The power of the anti-dew heater is about 5 W. It can be switched on and off in the software to save electricity.<br></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div>\\n<strong>Camera Spec:</strong><br><ul>\\n<li>Sensor: SONY IMX571 CMOS</li>\\n<li>Diagonal: 28.3mm</li>\\n<li>Image area: 23.5 x 15.7mm</li>\\n<li>Resolution: 26 Mega Pixel 6248 x 4176</li>\\n<li>Pixel Size: 3.76μm</li>\\n<li>Shutter: Rolling shutter</li>\\n<li>Exposure Range: 32μs-2000s</li>\\n<li>ROI: Supported</li>\\n<li>Read Noise: 1.0-3.3e</li>\\n<li>QE peak: 91%</li>\\n<li>Full well: 50000e</li>\\n<li>ADC:16bit</li>\\n<li>DDRIII Buffer: 256MB</li>\\n<li>Non-volatile memory/On camera storage: Build-in total 192K byte user-accessible space(image size up to 480X320)</li>\\n<li>Interface: USB3.0/USB2.0</li>\\n<li>Interface: USB3.0/USB2.0</li>\\n<li>Adaptor: M42X0.75</li>\\n<li>Protect window: D60-2 AR</li>\\n<li>Dimensions: 90mm Diameter</li>\\n<li>Weight: 700g</li>\\n<li>Back Focus Distance: 17.5mm</li>\\n<li>Cooling: Regulated Two-Stage TEC</li>\\n<li>Delta T: 35°C below ambient</li>\\n<li>Camera Power consumption: 1.15A at 5V</li>\\n<li>Cooler Power consumption: 12V at 3A Max</li>\\n<li>Working Temperature: -5°C - 50°C</li>\\n<li>Storage Temperature: -10°C - 60°C</li>\\n<li>Working Relative Humidity: 0% - 80%</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Max FPS at full resolution: (16Bit ADC)</em><br><ul>\\n<li>6248 × 4176 3.51fps</li>\\n<li>4096 × 3072 4.75fps</li>\\n<li>4096 × 2160 6.71fps</li>\\n<li>3840 × 2160 6.71fps</li>\\n<li>1920 × 1080 13.13fps</li>\\n<li>1280 × 720 19.29fps</li>\\n<li>640 × 480 28.06fps</li>\\n<li>320 × 240 51.44fps</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>Download the ASI 2600MM-P Manual <a>here</a></p>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>\\n', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000065-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 3190.77, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ASI2600MM-P_3.jpg?v=1632381005', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

It can be switched on and off in the software to save electricity.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Important: external power supply required:</em><br>This camera requires 1 amp minimum (even during uncooled operation), which is a problem for USB sockets on computers, because they are only designed for 900 mA, i.e. 0.9 Amps, therefore a 12V power supply is required to use this camera (sold separately).<br><strong>Camera Spec:</strong><br><ul>\\n<li>Sensor: SONY IMX455 CMOS</li>\\n<li>Diagonal: 43.3mm</li>\\n<li>Resolution: 62 Mega Pixel 9576 X 6388</li>\\n<li>Pixel Size: 3.76μm</li>\\n<li>Bayer Pattern: None</li>\\n<li>Shutter: Rolling shutter</li>\\n<li>Exposure Range: 32μs-2000s</li>\\n<li>ROI: Supported</li>\\n<li>Read Noise: 1.5-3.5e</li>\\n<li>QE peak: about 91%</li>\\n<li>Full well: 50000e</li>\\n<li>ADC:16bit</li>\\n<li>DDRIII Buffer: 256MB</li>\\n<li>Non-volatile memory/On camera storage: Build-in total 192K byte user-accessible space(image size up to 480X320)</li>\\n<li>Interface: USB3.0/USB2.0</li>\\n<li>Interface: USB3.0/USB2.0</li>\\n<li>Adaptor: M54X0.75</li>\\n<li>Protect window: D60-AR Coating</li>\\n<li>Dimensions: 90mm Diameter</li>\\n<li>Weight: 700g</li>\\n<li>Back Focus Distance: 17.5mm</li>\\n<li>Cooling: Regulated Two Stage TEC</li>\\n<li>Delta T: 35°C-35°C below ambient</li>\\n<li>Camera Power consumption: 650mA at 5V</li>\\n<li>Cooler Power consumption: 12V at 3A Max</li>\\n<li>Working Temperature: -5°C - 45°C</li>\\n<li>Storage Temperature: -20°C - 60°C</li>\\n<li>Working Relative Humidity: 20% - 80%</li>\\n<li>Storage Relative Humidity: 20% - 95%</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Max FPS at full resolution: (16Bit ADC)</em><br><ul>\\n<li>9576 × 6388 3.19fps</li>\\n<li>7680 × 4800 5.29fps</li>\\n<li>6400 × 4096 7.44fps</li>\\n<li>4096 × 2160 14.35fps</li>\\n<li>3840 × 2160 14.35fps</li>\\n<li>1920 × 1080 28.04fps</li>\\n<li>1280 × 720 41.12fps</li>\\n<li>640 × 480 59.67fps</li>\\n<li>320 × 240 108.72fps</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Download the ASI 6200MC-P Manual <a>here</a></p>\\n<p><span>Download the ASI 6200 55mm Back Focus Instructions\\xa0</span><a>here</a></p>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>\\n', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000068-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 5459.75, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ASI6200MMP_10.jpg?v=1632385130', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

For example, a large object like Jupiter has a red and blue color fringe and also appears distorted. This effect is caused by the refraction of light in the Earths atmosphere which acts like a prism. This effect becomes more prominent, depending on how high the object is above the horizon. The deeper the object is, the stronger the effect comes into play. Since especially in northern countries the planets are only very low, the effect here is particularly strong, and the corrector is particularly worthwhile here.<br><em>How does the ZWO ADC corrector work?</em><br>Our atmosphere refracts the light to varying degrees, depending on the wavelength. Red light is refracted differently than blue light. The closer the object is to the horizon, the stronger the effect. With the adjustment levers on the ADC, you adjust the two prisms in the corrector and thus counteract the effect of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, neutralizing this color shift. this makes a huge difference to the clarity and sharpness of your images.<br><em>Important Tip for use: </em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>For the maximum effect, the corrector must be correctly oriented to the horizon. This is usually the case when the superimposed handles of the compensator are parallel to the horizon line in the focuser.</li>\\n<li>It should be noted that in the case of equatorially mounted telescopes, the position to the horizon changes over time, which must of course be taken into account.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Connections on the corrector: T2 female/male thread</li>\\n<li>Also included: 1.25\" receptacle for telescope and 1.25\" adapter with ring clamping for eyepiece</li>\\n<li>Remuneration: Multicoating</li>\\n<li>Housing: Aluminium</li>\\n<li>Prisms: Two wedge-shaped prisms - rotatable to each other</li>\\n<li>Weight: approx. 200 grams</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For more information how to use this ADC please download the ZWO ADC Manual <a>here</a></p>\\n', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000079-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 161.06, 'Variant Price': 80.53, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ZWOADC125_3.jpg?v=1632413181', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

By controlling the mount with your smartphone using the free Star Book Ten Wireless app, you can easily use sky navigation functions such as automatic GoTo panning of celestial objects via your smartphone or tablet. By eliminating the power consumption of the conventional LCD (STAR BOOK TEN), the power consumption on the mount is reduced by up to 20%, thus enabling longer astronomical observation and astrophotography.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>When the desired celestial object is selected from a list, it is automatically panned into the telescope's field of view and tracking begins. \\xa0An existing Star Book Ten controller can also be used on this mount without any problems. The mount is equipped with the same precision stepper motors as the top model - the AXD mount, and the SXD2 WL brings a whole new standard of performance and precision to the Vixen mount family.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>With a photographic load capacity of 15kg, the axis cross of the mount weighs just 9.2kg making it ideal for mobile observations. In addition, the motors are mounted in the lower part of the mount and therefore also serve as a counterweight, so the mount requires fewer weights for balancing.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>The SXD2 mount in detail:</strong></p>\\n<p>Precision stepper motors and micro-step motion control system\\xa0<br>At the heart of the SXD2 are the precision stepper motors, which offer better performance and response than previous models. The micro-step motion control system offers powerful and yet very smooth drive characteristics, which are given both in fine movements and in fast pans. Built-in bearings The bearings of the RA and DEC axes and the worm shafts have been significantly improved to reduce the load on the motors. As a result, the motors move much more smoothly than in previous models.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>High-precision worm gears High-precision processing technologies eliminate worm gear errors. The edges of the two worms and worm wheels are particularly smooth, enabling very precise tracking. Declination axis as counterweight The solid motor units are installed in the lower part of the declination axis so that the center of gravity of the SXD2 is below the intersection point of the RA and DEC axes. This means you need fewer additional counterweights.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Latitude setting The latitude is adjustable between 0 and 70 degrees (divided into 3 zones and adjustable +/- 15 degrees per zone, for high, medium and low latitudes); latitude scale in 2-degree increments; fine adjustment with a tangent screw head, approx. 0.8 degrees per turn.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Built-in PFL-II polar finder with illumination:</strong><br>The built-in 5x20mm polar finder with 10° field of view has a 3-star alignment system. This eliminates the inconvenience of setting the date and original time. The illuminated reticle with variable brightness and automatic switch-off is adjustable in 8 levels and illuminated in red. The adjustment accuracy is 3 arc minutes.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>The wireless module in detail:<br></strong>The Vixen Wifi adapter for EQ mounts allows you to control your Vixen mount via a smartphone or tablet. With the smartphone app Star Book Wireless (free of charge) you can navigate the sky without any cables. The app turns your smartphone or tablet into a control unit for the equatorial mount in no time at all. The response delay of the mount, which is considered the biggest disadvantage of wireless connections, has been reduced to a level comparable to wired connections.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Reduced power consumption compared to conventional controllers with LCD monitor\\xa0<br>The power consumption of the mount is reduced by up to 20%, allowing longer observations than with conventional wired controllers such as the STAR BOOK TEN.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Operation similar to the Star Book Ten controller:\\xa0</strong><br>The Star Book Wireless app has a similar structure to the Star Book Ten controller. Depending on the star map setting, it contains up to 259,000 celestial objects. Tap on a celestial object in the object list and start the GoTo. The mount will now automatically move to this target and bring it into the telescope's field of view. All the popular features of the Star Book Ten are retained\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Convenient operation:</strong><br>When looking through the telescope operate the mount by swiping on the app's star chart. As there are no buttons, simply slide your finger over the star chart to operate the mount conveniently.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Extensive astronomical data included:</strong><br>In addition to data on easily observable celestial bodies such as Messier objects, NGC objects and IC objects, this also includes the sun, moon, planets, comets and dwarf planets.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>High-precision alignment:</strong><br>By aligning the mount to one or two stars, you can already achieve fairly precise positioning. By aligning the mount to three or more stars, you can achieve high-precision alignment of the mount for high magnifications. The objects are then approached precisely and centrally in your telescope's field of view. The alignment information is saved and can be retained even when the device is switched off. By leaving the telescope in its current state after completing an observation without moving it, you can start the automatic installation with the same settings for the next observation. \\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Individual setting options:\\xa0</strong><br>As with the Star Book Ten control unit, the app offers various individual settings, such as gear backlash compensation, night mode in red, autoguider and variable GoTo speed and LED brightness. You can also set the timing of the reversal of the objective tube (meridian flip) as desired. Even if the object moves to the south during tracking, you can prevent the telescope tube from reversing.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Important note: Cannot be used on old SX mounts with the old blue Star Book!\\xa0</strong></p>\\n<p>Technical information about the Wifi module: CPU with 32-bit CISC processor 120 MHz The unit is connected to the mount via a D-SUB 9PIN connector as with the STAR BOOK TEN. It has a 6-pin 6-wire modular plug for external autoguider operation.

The mounting housing is made from a stronger material than the previous SX mounts and the equatorial head is clamped into a fork in order to increase the stability of the polar alignment wedge.<br><em>Precise tracking with P-PEC function:</em><br>The SXP2 mount comes with the modern StarBook 10 control system. This includes a P-PEC function for precise tracking. PEC stands for “Periodic Error Corrections” and corrects errors in the mechanics which lead to periodic errors in the gear systems. The P-PEC function, which is based on the PEC function, is designed for the SXP2 equatorial mount. The P-PEC function saves the records of corrections, even after the power supply to the mount has been switched off. It is not necessary to re-enter the data each time, which enables a quicker setup and more precise tracking.<br><em>The belt drive system minimizes backlash and noise:</em><br>Conventional motor-driven systems on equatorial mounts use gear wheels, which are driven by the motor. However, this design generates backlash under the gear wheels, which can lead to inaccuracies. To avoid these errors, the drive was converted to a belt drive system. This drastically reduces the backlash of the gear unit, as well as the noise generated by the drive system. It also ensures a quicker reaction when corrections are required.<br><em>16 bearings:</em><br>The mechanical parts contain a total of 16 bearings. The SXP2 mount uses a set of tapered roller bearings for the RA axis in order to provide additional stability for more precise tracking.<br><em>Stable polar alignment wedge:</em><br>The SXP2 mount uses the same fork as the heavy AXJ mount. This new construction enables a quick and stable configuration of the latitude setting.<br><em>Simple and precise polar alignment via reference star:</em><br>The 6x20 polar finder scope is pre-installed. This allows the user to configure the polar alignment (for both the northern and southern hemispheres). The polar finder scope has a variable illuminated reticle with an automatic power-off function. The brightness can be adjusted in 8 levels so that the user can configure the desired brightness. The polar finder scope can be configured directly via three reference stars and can reach an accuracy of up to 3 arc minutes.<br><em>Variable mount head:</em><br>The mount head has a diameter of 35 mm and features 8 threaded holes for M8 screws spaced at 45 degrees. An optional accessory tray can be attached to the mount head directly or in combination with an optional mounting wedge for dovetail plates. The threaded holes on the mounting head can also be used to mount rails from other manufacturers.<br><em>Modern StarBook 10 controller with high-resolution colour display and built-in star chart:</em><br>The StarBook 10 controller is a modern control system with a high-resolution colour monitorand the system contains more than 272,000 celestial objects, including 260,000 stars from the SAO catalogue, 109 Messier objects, 7840 NGC objects and 5380 IC objects, as well the soon, moon and planets. Objects can be accessed by name, and information such as images and data can be defined separately.<br><em>A combination of innovative, elegant design and user-friendly features:</em><br>The improved design of the stable and rigid mount body, which features precise tracking with a P-PEC function and the STAR BOOK TEN controller, offers a highly precise, easy to use mount that is guaranteed to please astrophotographers and observers.<br><em>Special motor mount for lighter counterweight:</em><br>The heavy RA and DEC motor units are built into the bottom of the declination axis to ensure that the centre of gravity of the equatorial head is below the RA and DEC axis. This enables the declination body to function as a counterweight. Thanks to the flat mounting head, the mount can be balanced with a significantly lighter counterweight.<br><em>Retractable counterweight bar:</em><br>The counterweight bar is made from solid stainless steel with a thickness of 20 mm, and enables the use of all counterweights from the SX and GP mount series.

Unlike the old StarBook controller, the StarBook 10 controller saves these errors permanently. The periodic error of the mount is measured in the factory (total of 12 points per 30 degrees worm gear) and corrected before delivery. This is known as V-PEC and functions automatically as soon as you use the mount. It delivers an accuracy of +/- 4.0 arc seconds. You can increase the tracking accuracy further by saving your own recorded periodic errors.<br>Vixen uses a new belt-drive system in the AXJ mount and the gear drive was replaced with a toothed belt. This gives the mount a quicker reaction time and lower backlash and also helps to minimize noise. The 6x20 polar finder scope is pre-installed into the mount. This allows the user to configure the polar alignment (for both the northern and southern hemispheres). The polar finder scope has a variable illuminated reticle with an automatic power-off function. The brightness can be adjusted in 8 levels so that the user can configure the desired brightness.<br>The mount has 2 bearing sets (4 pieces) which are used for the shaft of the RA axis. Thanks to the newly developed EQ design, the AXJ mount has a higher load capacity of 22 kg. As the motors, worm shaft and worm gear are located in the lower part of the mount, fewer counterweights are required than with conventional mounts and with some smaller OTA's no counterweight at all is required.<br><em>The StarBook 10 controller:</em><br>The StarBook 10 system contains more than 272,000 celestial objects, including 260,000 stars from the SAO catalogue, 109 Messier objects, 7840 NGC objects and 5380 IC objects, as well the soon, moon and planets.

Its ideal for very light optics such as small 60mm - 80mm Refractors or as a Star tracker for larger DSLR cameras with larger lenses. It has no hand controller and is completely controlled using a tablet, laptop or desktop computer - either via Wifi or directly wired.<br>The PMC-Eight with its versatile connections is supported\\xa0by free downloadable apps for Windows, Android, and iOS ready to connect to your favorite ASCOM Compliant Astronomical Software, allowing you to control the telescope from a few feet away or\\xa0via an Internet connection from virtually anywhere in the world. <br>One of the standout features of the iEXOS-100 system is its German equatorial design. When it comes to tracking the stars with a telescope, there is nothing that compares to a German equatorial mount because it will follow objects as they rise in the east and set in the west. Before you can track an object, you need to find it, and that objective can be daunting when you’re faced with a vast expanse of inky black sky. The iEXOS-100 puts a powerful GOTO system at your finger tips that takes the frustration out of navigating the night sky. This integrated version of Explore Scientific’s PMC-Eight™ system transcends the industry standard single processor by utilizing eight CPUs that operate independently of one another to focus on defined functions. This delegation of tasks among the processors results in a system that offers superior responsiveness, efficiency, reliability and astoundingly fast timing intervals for seamless images and accurate tracking. <br>Although it is internally complex, the GOTO system can be easily operated from your own Apple, Android or Windows tablet using the ExploreStars app, which has an intuitive nature that makes it simple and quick to align your telescope, navigate the stars and learn specifics about tens of thousands of celestial objects. The iEXOS-100 has locking clutches that will let you quickly reposition your telescope from one side to the other and an altitude knob for smooth height adjustments. The mount base includes a small polar alignment tunnel that allows users to roughly align their observing setup with Polaris. It also has a simple bubble level that comes in handy when stabilizing your tripod. Other features include a bracket for holding the battery pack, which powers the PMC-Eight system™ through 8 C batteries (not included); two 1 kg counterweights for balancing; and glow-in-the-dark markers on certain points of the mount and tripod so you can stay oriented with your setup at night.<br><em>Important Note:</em><br>To start using the ExploreStars app, download the free app and download the celestial data set that contains the astronomical catalogs, reference images, and reference text. Simply by unzipping the ExploreStars folder containing the expanded celestial data set into your Pictures directory, you will expand the native database from a thousand objects to over seventy thousand objects. <br><strong>Mount Specs:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Integrated Explore Scientific PMC-Eight™ Wifi GOTO system</li>\\n<li>Beautiful full graphical user interface using the Explore Stars App</li>\\n<li>Wifi controlled by Tablet, Notebook or Desktop PC with 7\" or larger display, and Wifi function (computer device not included)</li>\\n<li>Classic four-button pattern and virtual joystick for guiding, centering, moving and slewing on the touch screen</li>\\n<li>Intuitive 2 star and 3 star alignment procedure</li>\\n<li>Includes a small polar alignment tunnel</li>\\n<li>Standard Vixen Style Dovetail Adapter</li>\\n<li>Astrophotography load capacity - 7kg</li>\\n<li>Multiprocessor Micro Controller with 8 CPU´s</li>\\n<li>Micro-Stepper Motors and worm gears</li>\\n<li>Silent Belt-Drive System</li>\\n<li>Mini-USB port for INDI/ASCOM wired computer connection</li>\\n<li>ST-4 compatible autoguider port</li>\\n<li>INDI and ASCOM Driver available: YES, supports also Pulse-Guiding</li>\\n<li>Glow-in-the-dark markings on mount and tripod</li>\\n<li>Weight mount-head: 4.0 kg ; weight tripod: 2.5 kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Explore Scientific iEXOS-100 PMC-8 Wifi Goto Mount</li>\\n<li>Stainless steel tripod with bubble level</li>\\n<li>Counter weight 2 x 1.0 kg</li>\\n<li>Battery compartment 12 volts with bracket / (8 x C-Cells not included)</li>\\n<li>Coil-cord for DEC motor</li>\\n<li>ExploreStars Software via download for free</li>\\n<li>Instruction manual</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Download the iEXOS 100 Mount Manual <a>here</a><br>Download the Explore Stars App <a>here</a></p>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000104-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 485.2, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ExploreScientificiEXOS100PMC8Mount_5.jpg?v=1633207110', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

Simply place the entire telescope on a stable table or flat surface\\xa0and align it to view the desired object. The Messier 6\" Dobsonian telescope is delivered largely pre-assembled and is therefore ready to go after a few minutes. With the 150 mm diameter optics, observation is not limited to the moon and the planets of our solar system - you can look\\xa0much further into the\\xa0night sky and observe globular clusters, nebulae and galaxies.<br>The wide-field optics with a low focal ratio of f/5.0 simplifies the finding and observation of even faint objects in the night sky.<br>This 6\" Dobsonian is also equipped with a large 2.0\" focuser, which allows the use of 2.0\" eyepieces with even larger fields of<br>view. Due to the included eyepiece adapter even 1.25\" eyepieces can be used.<br>The parabolic primrary mirror offers significantly better image sharpness and contrast than comparable telescopes with a simple spherical mirrors. In addition to this, the telescope has a particularly large secondary mirror of 55mm diameter for an ideal illumination of the image field. The entire telescope tube can be moved and twisted in the tube clamps. The telescope OTA also has a standard GP dovetail bar, which means that the optics can also be used on almost any other telescope mount with a vixen fitting.<br><strong>Telescope Specs:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optical design: Reflector</li>\\n<li>Mirror diameter:\\xa0150 mm</li>\\n<li>Focal length:\\xa0750 mm / f/5</li>\\n<li>Maximum recommended magnification: x\\xa0300</li>\\n<li>High quality BRESSER Newton optics</li>\\n<li>Parabolic primary mirror</li>\\n<li>Primary mirror diameter:\\xa0150 mm</li>\\n<li>2.0\"\\xa0Rack &amp; Pinion focuser.</li>\\n<li>primary mirror made using special-purpose glass with very little thermal expansion</li>\\n<li>OTA can be attached to other mountings</li>\\n<li>Differently sized adjusting- and lock-screws</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Dimensions &amp; Weight:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Net weight OTA: (incl. accessories)\\xa04.7 kg</li>\\n<li>Total length:\\xa039 cm</li>\\n<li>Total width:\\xa039 cm</li>\\n<li>Total height:\\xa082 cm</li>\\n<li>Tube diameter:\\xa0180 mm</li>\\n<li>Tube length:\\xa0685 mm</li>\\n<li>Net Weight total (incl. accessories):\\xa09.2 kg</li>\\n<li>Net weight mount (incl. accessories): 4.5 kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ul>\\n<li>Newtonian Reflector</li>\\n<li>Lens Solar Filter</li>\\n<li>2 tube clamps with universal dovetail rail</li>\\n<li>Telescopic mount with universal prism mount</li>\\n<li>25mm + 9mm Waiter Eyepiece (Ø 31.7mm / 1.25\\'\\')</li>\\n<li>Eyepiece adapter 2.0\\'\\' to 1.25\\'\\'</li>\\n<li>LED light point viewfinder (battery incl.)</li>\\n<li>Moon filter (Ø 31.7 mm / 1.25\\'\\')</li>\\n<li>Operating instructions</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>SAFETY NOTICE:</em> <span>Never look directly at the Sun through your Binoculars or Telescope\\xa0- immediate and permanent eye damage may result.

The 60 mm ring on the focuser allows you to attach 2\" eyepieces and a camera adapter. While the AX103S has been specially developed for professional astrophotography purposes, its also a real visual highlight, especially when observing the moon and planets using an eyepiece. This is a telescope that will delight you for a lifetime.<br><strong>The AXD2 mount in detail:</strong><br><span>The Observatory class AXD2 mount comes with the new \\'Starbook Ten\\' controller and the PFL polar finder, which makes it quick and easy to align the mount via reference stars.\\xa0</span>Robust construction and a lightweight housing with a photographic load capacity of 30 kg. The A7075 Super alloy, which is the strongest aluminum alloy available, is used for the R.A. and DEC axes. <br>The stability of the A7075 superalloy is stronger than titanium, which is known as a lightweight material for high strength. Its density is 38% less than titanium. The use of the A7075 super alloy for the axles makes the AXD mount lightweight yet stable. The rotating parts of the AXD mount have a total of 21 bearings ensuring the smoothest of movement.<br><em>Stepper motors:</em><br>Vixen chose more accurate stepper motors for this mount in order to exploit the full performance potential. The disadvantage of stepper motors with large steps has been eliminated by the Micro-Step Motion Control System. The system generates 400 pulses per second at high speed. This creates a very quiet sampling without vibrations while the stepper motors of the AXD mount have more than sufficient torque for higher loads. This is most evident when working at high magnification and astrophotography using CCD astrophotography cameras with small pixel sizes.<br><em>Worm gears:</em><br>The sizes of the worm gears have been increased in the latest Atlux version. The AXD mount has 270 teeth in R.A. and 216 teeth in DC. Both axes are 50 mm in diameter. As a result, the mount achieves a high degree of accuracy and running stability.<br><em>Low backlash:</em><br>Thanks to the Vixen Micro-Step Motion Control System, the stepper motors run extremely smoothly from low to high speed. This eliminates the use of reduction gears in the drive system and therefore reduces the play in the gears.<br><em>Elegant design:</em><br>The flat sides of the mount have been taken from previous generations of the New Atlux range. The white and silver-coloured housing ensures a modern and elegant exterior with high functionality. This AXD mount is the flagship of the Vixen mount series.<br><em>Polar finder telescope:</em><br>The AXD mount is equipped with a 6 x 20 polar finder telescope as standard. With the scale built into the polar finder, you can achieve a simple and accurate poler alignment in the northern hemisphere.<br>For observation in southern latitudes, the constellation Octans is imaged in the polar viewfinder, which is then set congruently with the real stars.<br><em>Periodic Errors Correction VPEC:</em><br>Usually, periodic errors are measured on mounts and corrected by the user. Since the old StarBook did not save this error permanently, the Starbook Ten has addressed this problem. The periodic error of the mount is now measured in the factory and eliminated before delivery. This is called VPEC and it works automatically as soon as you use the mount.<br>They achieve an accuracy of +/- 2.8 arc seconds. You will be able to further increase tracking accuracy by saving your own recorded periodic errors.<br><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong><br><ul>\\n<li>Optical Design: Triplet Refractor</li>\\n<li>Lens Material: Ohara Japan FPL-53 ED Glass</li>\\n<li>Aperture: 103mm</li>\\n<li>Focal Length: 890</li>\\n<li>Focal Ratio: f/8</li>\\n<li>Resolution: 1.13 arc Seconds</li>\\n<li>Observatorty class GOTO AXD2 Mount<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking accuracy of +/- 2.8 arc seconds</li>\\n<li>Mount with 35 kg\\xa0payload capacity (30kg photographic)</li>\\n<li>Modern STARBOOK TEN control with autoguider input</li>\\n<li>Illuminated polar viewfinder with direct star adjustment</li>\\n<li>Very stable vibration-free P85DX observatory column</li>\\n<li>Total weight: 64.6 kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ol>\\n<li>TR102 Tripod</li>\\n<li>AX103S Apochromat</li>\\n<li>AXD2 Goto Mount</li>\\n<li>AXD Half Column</li>\\n<li>2 counterweights 1.5 and 7.0 kg</li>\\n<li>7x50 viewfinder telescope</li>\\n<li>Folding mirror</li>\\n<li>Carrying handle</li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000108-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 15189.05, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/VixenAXD2103EDTripletTelescope_9.jpg?v=1633957541', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

With its large aperture of 260mm (10\"), this optical telescope collects a huge amount of light for serious professional observations and photography of the planets, as well as countless deep-sky objects.</strong><br>The dielectrically coated mirrors of the VMV260L guarantee extremely high sharpness and maximum brightness. Thanks to the open tube, these devices also cool down faster than conventional closed Cassegrain systems. For further expansion, an optional 0.62x focal reducer is available to reduce the aperture ratio to 1:7.1. This results in a shortening of the exposure times and easier photography of larger objects. Included with this telescope is a dovetail rail and a carrying handle, which can also be used as a camera mount for star field shots.<br><strong>The AXD2 mount in detail:</strong><br>This hight quality professional grade mount is made from using robust construction and a lightweight housing with a max load capacity of 30 kg (Photographic). The A7075 Super alloy, which is the strongest of aluminum alloys, is used for the R.A. and DEC axes. The stability of the A7075 superalloy is stronger than titanium, which is known as a lightweight material with extremely high strength. Its density is 38% less than titanium. The use of the A7075 super alloy for the axles makes the AXD mount lightweight yet stable and the rotating parts of the AXD mount have a total of 21 bearings. This ensures a very even movement to pan and track objects.<br><em>Stepper Motors:</em><br>Vixen chose more accurate stepper motors for the mount to excercise its full performance potential. The disadvantage of large stepper motors with equally large steps has been eliminated by the Micro-Step Motion Control System which generates 400 pulses per second at high speed. This creates a very quiet sampling without vibrations and the stepper motors of the AXD mount have more than sufficient torque for high loading equipment. This is most evident when working at high magnification and photographing using CCD photography with small pixel sizes.<br><em>Worm gears:</em><br>The sizes of the worm gears have been increased in the latest Atlux version. The AXD mount has 270 teeth in R.A. and 216 teeth in DC. Both axes are 50mm in diameter. As a result, the mount achieves a very high degree of accuracy and running stability.<br><em>Low play:</em><br>Thanks to the Vixen Micro-Step Motion Control System, the stepper motors run extremely smoothly from low to high speed. This eliminates the use of reduction gears in the drive and therefore reduces the play in the transmission.<br><em>Elegant design:</em><br>The flat sides of the mount have been taken from previous generations of the New Atlux range. The white and silver-coloured housing ensures a modern and elegant exterior with high functionality - The AXD is the flagship of the Vixen mount series.<br>The AXD mount is equipped with a 6x20 polar finder telescope as standard. With the scale built into the polar finder, you can achieve a simple and accurate pole alignment in the northern hemisphere and for observation in southern latitudes, the constellation Octans is viewed in the polar viewfinder, which is then set congruently with the real stars.<br><em>Periodic Errors Correction VPEC:</em><br>Usually, periodic errors are measured on mounts and corrected by the user. Since the old StarBook did not save this error permanently, the Starbook Ten has addressed this problem and now the periodic error of the mount is measured in the factory and eliminated before delivery. This is called VPEC and works automatically as soon as you use the mount. They achieve an accuracy of +/- 2.8 arc seconds. You will even be able to further increase tracking accuracy by saving your own recorded periodic error.<br><strong>Telescope &amp; Mount Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>AXD2 Goto mount with VMC260L telescope</li>\\n<li>OTA Aperture: 260mm</li>\\n<li>OTA Focal Length: 3000mm</li>\\n<li>Focal Ratio: f/11.5</li>\\n<li>Resolution:\\xa00.45 arc seconds</li>\\n<li>Mount with 30 kg load capacity (Photographic)</li>\\n<li>Modern Starbook Ten control with autoguider input</li>\\n<li>More than 270,000 celestial objects stored</li>\\n<li>Illuminated polar viewfinder with direct star adjustment</li>\\n<li>Professional Maksutov-Cassegrain with 260 mm opening</li>\\n<li>Very stable metal observatories column</li>\\n<li>Total weight: 70.1 kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Whats included:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>VMC 260 Maksutov-Cassegrain Telescope</li>\\n<li>P85 Observatories Column</li>\\n<li>2 counterweights 1.5 and 7.0 kg</li>\\n<li>7x50 viewfinder telescope</li>\\n<li>Folding mirror</li>\\n<li>Carrying handle</li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000110-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 17316.24, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/VixenADX2VMC260Telescope_1.jpg?v=1634245570', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

This set contains all the components required (excl. the camera) for a quick and comfortable entry into the world of astrophotography: <br><strong>How to get setup:</strong><br>After setting up the lightweight and compact photo mount, simply set the approximate latitude (pole height) on the tripod head MH-100 and target the polar star with the help of the optical polar finder. Then mount the camera with photo lens with the help of the quick-release plate on the heavy ball head included. With the ball head, the camera can be aligned and re-positioned at any time to any section of the sky. As soon as the tracking motor is switched on, the long exposure can be started immediately. All this takes less than 5 minutes to setup.<br><strong>Camera Suitability:</strong><br>All cameras with 1/4\" (6.3mm) tripod connection thread and the bulb B setting option for long exposure.<br>The Bresser photo mount is designed to carry and follow a camera with a lens of up to 2.0 kg total weight in polar mode.<br>In azimuthal mode, the mount also carries cameras with up to 5.0 kg Weight. Fast wide-angle lenses are ideal for starting off, because as the lens focal length and exposure time increase, so to do the requirements for tracking accuracy. Therefore, a shot of several minutes with a wide-angle lens can be taken without problems and the stars remain pin point sharp.<br>For example, with a long focal length such as a 200mm telephoto lens, the polar alignment of the photo mount must be exactly right which can be done quickly with the integrated alignment tunnel for aligning with the polar star. Typically achievable exposure times with good tracking accuracy are: 16mm wide-angle lens: 5 minutes (300sec.) - Perfect for dramatic shots of the Milkyway and with a 100mm telephoto lens: 1 minute (60sec.)<br>The tracking is carried out by a precise stepper motor which can be adjusted at different speeds via the operating menu. The low power consumption allows operation of up to 20 hours with a set of batteries or any length of time via USB connection.<br><strong>StarTracker Astrophoto Mount features:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Astrophoto mount for equatorial tracking</li>\\n<li>Automatic compensation of the earth\\'s rotation</li>\\n<li>Extremely compact design - fits in almost any photo bag</li>\\n<li>Different tracking speeds adjustable</li>\\n<li>Switchable for northern and southern hemisphere</li>\\n<li>Time-lapse function and azimuthal movement adjustable from 15min to 48 hours</li>\\n<li>Ball head with quick-release plate and 1/4\\'\\' photo thread for camera mounting</li>\\n<li>Photo mount with 1/4\\'\\' threaded bolt for ball head mounting</li>\\n<li>Additional quick coupling for removing the ball head</li>\\n<li>Precise stepper motor tracking with worm gear</li>\\n<li>Clear LC display for easy operation</li>\\n<li>Battery operation (4 x AA) or via micro USB socket (Batt. not included)</li>\\n<li>Battery life: up to 20 hours</li>\\n<li>Weight of the astrophoto mount: 0.63 kg</li>\\n<li>Transport weight incl. compl.

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'Vixen Sphinx SXD2 WL German Equatorial Mount & Tripod', 'Type': 'Astrophotography Payload > 15kg', 'Body (HTML)': \"<p><strong>Vixen has developed a new generation of Wireless Controlled SX mounts for demanding observers and Astrophotographers.</strong></p>\\n<p>The SXD2WL mount is easily operated via a WiFi module through a smartphone or tablet. The free STAR BOOK Wireless app is available for user-friendly control of the mount and this allows you to easily use practical celestial navigation functions such as automatic GoTo slewing to specific celestial objects via your smartphone or tablet. The mount's power consumption has also been reduced by up to 20% which enables astronomical observations and astrophotography over longer periods, especially in the field when using a Portable power supply.</p>\\n<p>Once you tap the desired celestial object from a list on the APP, the mount is automatically slewed to bring the object into the telescope's field of view and tracking begins. An existing STAR BOOK TEN control system can also be used on this mount without any problems. Equipped with the same precision stepper motors as the top-of-the-line AXD mount, the SXD2WL brings a new standard of performance and precision to the Vixen mount family and this mount is capable of a Photographic payload of 15kg.</p>\\n<p>The mount's axis system weighs just 9.2kg , making it ideal for mobile observing . The motors located in the lower part of the mount also act as counterweights, meaning the mount requires less weight for balancing and only larger or longer Telescopes require the use of the counterweight. The massive motor units are installed in the lower part of the declination axis, so the center of gravity of the SXD2 is below the intersection of the RA and DEC axes.</p>\\n<p>The heart of the SXD2 are the precision stepper motors, which offer better performance and response than previous models. The Micro-Step Motion Control system scores points with its powerful yet very smooth drive characteristics, which are present in both fine movements and fast panning. The bearings on the RA and DEC axes and the worm gears have been significantly improved to reduce the load on the motors. This allows the motors to run much more smoothly than in previous models. High-precision processing technologies also eliminate worm gear errors. The edges of both the worms and worm gears are particularly smooth, enabling extremely precise tracking.</p>\\n<p><em>Latitude Adjustment:</em><br>The latitude is adjustable between 0 and 70 degrees (divided into 3 zones, each adjustable by +/- 15 degrees, for high, medium, and low latitudes); the latitude scale is scaled in 2-degree increments; fine adjustment is achieved with a tangent screw head, approximately 0.8 degrees per turn.</p>\\n<p><em>Built-in PFL-II Polar Finder with Illumination:</em><br>The built-in 5x20 mm polar finder with a 10° field of view features a 3-star alignment system, eliminating the hassle of setting the date and time. The illuminated reticle with variable brightness and automatic shutoff is adjustable in 8 levels and illuminated in red. The adjustment accuracy is 3 arc minutes.</p>\\n<p><em>The wireless module in detail:</em><br>The Vixen WiFi adapter for EQ mounts \\xa0allows you to control your Vixen mount via a smartphone or tablet. This allows you to navigate the sky without any cables using the STAR BOOK Wireless smartphone app (free). The app instantly transforms your mobile device into a controller for the equatorial mount. The response time of the mount, which is considered the biggest disadvantage of wireless connections, has been reduced to a level comparable to that of wired solutions.</p>\\n<p><em>Operation similar to the STAR BOOK TEN controller:</em><br>The STAR BOOK Wireless app is structured in a similar way to that already known from the STAR BOOK TEN controller. Depending on the star map setting, it contains up to 259,000 celestial objects . Tap a celestial object in the object list and start the GoTo. The mount will then automatically move to this target and bring it into the telescope's field of view. You retain all the popular features of the traditional STAR BOOK TEN.</p>\\n<p><em>Convenient operation:</em><br>While looking through the telescope, you operate the mount by swiping on the app's star map. Since there are no buttons, you can simply glide your finger over the star map and operate the mount conveniently.</p>\\n<p><em>Extensive astronomical data included:</em><br>This includes data on easily observable celestial bodies such as Messier objects, NGC objects, and IC objects, as well as the sun, moon, planets, comets, and dwarf planets.</p>\\n<p><em>High-precision alignment:</em><br>Alignment to one or two stars allows you to position the mount quite precisely. Alignment to three or more stars allows for high-precision alignment of the mount for high magnifications. The objects are then moved precisely and centrally in the field of view of your telescope. The alignment information is saved and can be retained even when the device is turned off. By leaving the telescope in its current state without moving it after completing an observation, you can start with the same settings the next time you observe.</p>\\n<p><em>Custom setting options:</em><br>As with the STAR BOOK TEN control system, the app offers various custom settings such as gear backlash compensation, night mode in red, autoguider, as well as variable GoTo speed and LED brightness. You can also adjust the time of the lens tube reversal (meridian flip) as desired.

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'Vixen Sphinx SXP2 Professional German Equatorial Mount & CF Tripod', 'Type': 'Astrophotography Payload > 25kg', 'Body (HTML)': '<p>The new SXP2 mount features larger bearings in order to increase the accuracy and load capacity. The mounting housing is made from a stronger material than the previous SX mounts and the equatorial head is clamped into a fork in order to increase the stability of the polar alignment wedge.<br><em>Precise tracking with P-PEC function:</em><br>The SXP2 mount comes with the modern StarBook 10 control system. This includes a P-PEC function for precise tracking. PEC stands for “Periodic Error Corrections” and corrects errors in the mechanics which lead to periodic errors in the gear systems. The P-PEC function, which is based on the PEC function, is designed for the SXP2 equatorial mount. The P-PEC function saves the records of corrections, even after the power supply to the mount has been switched off. It is not necessary to re-enter the data each time, which enables a quicker setup and more precise tracking.<br><em>The belt drive system minimizes backlash and noise:</em><br>Conventional motor-driven systems on equatorial mounts use gear wheels, which are driven by the motor. However, this design generates backlash under the gear wheels, which can lead to inaccuracies. To avoid these errors, the drive was converted to a belt drive system. This drastically reduces the backlash of the gear unit, as well as the noise generated by the drive system. It also ensures a quicker reaction when corrections are required.<br><em>16 bearings:</em><br>The mechanical parts contain a total of 16 bearings. The SXP2 mount uses a set of tapered roller bearings for the RA axis in order to provide additional stability for more precise tracking.<br><em>Stable polar alignment wedge:</em><br>The SXP2 mount uses the same fork as the heavy AXJ mount. This new construction enables a quick and stable configuration of the latitude setting.<br><em>Simple and precise polar alignment via reference star:</em><br>The 6x20 polar finder scope is pre-installed. This allows the user to configure the polar alignment (for both the northern and southern hemispheres). The polar finder scope has a variable illuminated reticle with an automatic power-off function. The brightness can be adjusted in 8 levels so that the user can configure the desired brightness. The polar finder scope can be configured directly via three reference stars and can reach an accuracy of up to 3 arc minutes.<br><em>Variable mount head:</em><br>The mount head has a diameter of 35 mm and features 8 threaded holes for M8 screws spaced at 45 degrees. An optional accessory tray can be attached to the mount head directly or in combination with an optional mounting wedge for dovetail plates. The threaded holes on the mounting head can also be used to mount rails from other manufacturers.<br><em>Modern StarBook 10 controller with high-resolution colour display and built-in star chart:</em><br>The StarBook 10 controller is a modern control system with a high-resolution colour monitorand the system contains more than 272,000 celestial objects, including 260,000 stars from the SAO catalogue, 109 Messier objects, 7840 NGC objects and 5380 IC objects, as well the soon, moon and planets. Objects can be accessed by name, and information such as images and data can be defined separately.<br><em>A combination of innovative, elegant design and user-friendly features:</em><br>The improved design of the stable and rigid mount body, which features precise tracking with a P-PEC function and the STAR BOOK TEN controller, offers a highly precise, easy to use mount that is guaranteed to please astrophotographers and observers.<br><em>Special motor mount for lighter counterweight:</em><br>The heavy RA and DEC motor units are built into the bottom of the declination axis to ensure that the centre of gravity of the equatorial head is below the RA and DEC axis. This enables the declination body to function as a counterweight. Thanks to the flat mounting head, the mount can be balanced with a significantly lighter counterweight.<br><em>Retractable counterweight bar:</em><br>The counterweight bar is made from solid stainless steel with a thickness of 20 mm, and enables the use of all counterweights from the SX and GP mount series. The counterweight bar is housed in the declination body.</p>\\n<p><em>High Strength Carbon Fiber Tripod:<br></em><span>Despite being developed for heavy mounts, the Vixen ASG CB90 carbon tripod is one of the lightest tripods on the market.\\xa0The hand nuts can be loosened to extend the tripod by one section.

With a combination of the best features of the Sphinx series and the new Starbook Ten controller, Vixen has developed a new generation of SX mounts for demanding observers and astrophotographers alike.</span><br><span>The SXD2 is quieter in its tracking than the previous SX mounts and the increased precision of the motors allows for improved performance during long exposures in astrophotography. Precision stepper motors and the micro-step motion control system are at the heart of the SXD2, which offer even better performance and response times than other mount models.</span><br><span>The bearings of the R.A. and DEC axes and the worm shafts have been significantly improved to reduce the load on the motors. This makes the movement of the mount extremely quiet and more robust R.A. and DEC shafts increase the performance and overall robustness of the SXD2 mount.</span><br><strong>The STARBOOK TEN controller features:</strong><br><em>Large LCD color monitor:</em><br><span>The LCD monitior of the STAR BOOK TEN has a 5 inch TFT Color Liquid crystal display with high WVGA (800×480 pixels, 65,535 colors) resolution.</span><br><em>Functional Moon Map:</em><br><span>The latest version of the STAR BOOK TEN firmware includes a \"Moon Map\" function. This allows the user to view a map of the visible part of the moon on the screen. All major landmarks on the surface of the moon are highlighted and can be selected for the GoTo feature.</span><br><em>Night mode in red:</em><br><span>During astronomical observations at night, the eyes of the observer adapt to the darkness. The observer sees less of the night sky because bright white light reduces this dark adaptation of the eyes. For this reason, the display of the Starbook Ten can be switched to red backlight. The red light does not affect this dark adaptation as much as white light.</span><br><em>Illuminated buttons:</em><br><span>All command and direction buttons can be illuminated in red so that you can keep track even in the dark. The illuminated buttons can be switched on or off.</span><br><em>Fast CPU:</em><br><span>Starbook Ten has a CPU with 324 MHz clock frequency, which is about 5 times as fast as the CPU of the old STAR BOOK. This will make the star map load faster and make the screen more vivid.</span><br><em>Simple menu:</em><br><span>With the STAR BOOK TEN you can call up your celestial bodies in both scope and chart mode. In addition, you can select your objects by scrolling the star map in chart mode. Frequently used menus can be found on any of the ten buttons. This allows you to quickly and easily reach the most important functions directly at the touch of a button.</span><br><em>Object Database:</em><br><span>The STAR BOOK TEN contains more than 270,000 celestial objects, including 258,977 stars from the SAO star catalog, 109 Messier objects, 7,840 objects and NGC 5386 IC objects, the sun, the moon and the planets of our solar system. Simply call the objects with their common names.</span><br><em>P-PEC function:</em><br><span>You can save a periodic error correction to improve tracking accuracy of the mount. This is stored and retained even if you turn off the device and put it back into operation the next time.</span><br><em>On the hunt for satellites:</em><br><span>You can enter the orbital elements of a satellite directly into the Starbook via the LAN connection of a PC. You can store up to 10 satellites in your Starbook.</span><br><em>Viewing Comets:</em><br><span>You can enter the orbital elements of a comet directly into the Starbook via a LAN connection of a PC. You can save up to 10 comets in your Starbook.</span><br><em>User defined objects:</em><br><span>The Starbook Ten is able to save user-defined objects. You can save other interesting celestial objects that you want to observe or photograph on your Starbook Ten. You can enter position data of up to 10 objects directly on the Starbook Ten or via the LAN connection of a PC.</span><br><em>Multiple tracking speeds:</em><br><span>It is possible to change the speed rate according to the type of object you are observing. The movement of the sun, moon, planets or comets can be tracked at different speeds.</span><br><em>Advanced alignment algorithm:</em><br><span>You can achieve an exact alignment of the mount by simply approaching 2 stars with a distance of at least 10 degrees one after the other and saving them. You can enter the position data of up to 20 stars on the Starbook Ten controller.</span><br><span>The more stars you store, the more accurate the positioning of the mount will become. If you save more than 20 stars, existing position data will be deleted The Starbook Ten memory has a large backup storage in which your information can be stored. This allows you to turn off the device and conserve the batteries. When the mount resumes its work, the data remains stored.</span><br><em>Atmospheric refraction:</em><br><span>This option allows you to compensate for or reduce atmospheric refraction on the celestial objects near the horizon.</span><br><em>Cross Over Meridian:</em><br><span>The mount has a safety function that rotates the optical tube in the opposite direction when the observation object comes to its highest position to prevent the optics from hitting the mount. However, you are free to choose or turn off this feature if you want to shoot with your equipment.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span>Optics:\\xa0115 SD Refractor.

Nowhere else do you get so much light gathering ability for your money as with a good Dobsonian Telescope.<br>At 406mm (16\") Aperture things start to get very serious in terms of what you can see through the eyepiece. The Moon and Planets are simply\\xa0incredible and even fainter objects like Galaxies and nebula start to show lots of real detail and structure as well as hints of colour - Particularly if you are viewing from a dark sky location. A telescope with a mirror diameter of 406mm collects more than\\xa03300 times as much light than the naked eye.<br>The easy disassembly of this telescope allows for problem-free transport, even in relatively small cars - the assembly then is quick and easy without the need for tools. The entire construction has been optimized for maximum stiffness without neglecting weight. The combination of large height wheels with an optimized aluminum sandwich construction enables the finest correction movements at the highest magnifications. The focus position has already been prepared for the use of a coma corrector.\\xa0<br><strong>Transport dimensions for mobile use:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Rockerbox: 550mm x 550mm x 330mm, Mirror box 480mm x 480mm x 300mm,</li>\\n<li>Rod length approx: 1250mm<br></li>\\n<li>Viewing height in zenith position approx: 1.63m, <br></li>\\n<li>Total weight: 38.4 kg, 16\" mirror box: 23.8kg, 16\" top with secondary mirror + bottom rocker box: 10.5 kg, 16\" 4 pairs of struts: 2.5kg, 16\" height wheels pair: 1.6kg<br></li>\\n<li>Threaded connection focuser: M54 x 0.75 mm</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Tubular all-aluminium construction.</li>\\n<li>Aperture: 16\"</li>\\n<li>Focal Length: 1826mm</li>\\n<li>Focal Ratio: f/4.5</li>\\n<li>Mirror Material: BK-7</li>\\n<li>Plain bearings made of Teflon and GRP, resulting in very sensitive tracking.</li>\\n<li>Improved primary mirror cell with precise adjustment mechanism.</li>\\n<li>Friction adjustment on both sides and brake system for the height bearings.</li>\\n<li>Universal viewfinder shoe for an easy viewfinder upgrade is required.</li>\\n<li>Quick-release fasteners with spring loaded elements for more comfortable handling.</li>\\n<li>Powder-coated height wheels for better durability.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats Included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Lattice tube Dobson Telescope</li>\\n<li>LED viewfinder with standard viewfinder shoe</li>\\n<li>Scattered light protection for secondary mirror cage</li>\\n<li>Adjustment tool for main mirrors</li>\\n<li>Battery box with pocket for fan</li>\\n<li>Balancing weights 2 x 1.0 kg</li>\\n<li>Extension sleeve for focuser</li>\\n<li>Reduction adapter 2\" to 1.25\"</li>\\n<li>Operating instructions</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><em>SAFETY NOTICE:</em> <span>Never look directly at the Sun through your Binoculars or Telescope\\xa0- immediate and permanent eye damage may result.

The experience of viewing the night sky using extremely high power with both eyes is quite a memorable experience, making you feel like you can reach out and literally touch the stars. <br>The new Explore Scientific U-mount with field tripod also fits most other binoculars from 70 to 120mm lens diameter, which have a 1/4 inch photo thread connection on the underside. With the U-mount there is no shaking or annoying vibrations, the combination is as solid as a rock and provides the unlimited observation pleasure in all binocular positions. Whether you are observing the starry sky or the landscape, the U-mount allows soft and smooth movements in both axis.<br>The Explore Scientific U-mount has an excellent mechanism with adjustable friction in both axis, which allows you to adjust the friction to your preference making movement and tracking much more comfortable even when fully loaded. The binoculars can be mounted and removed in a few seconds using the quick-release adapter plate included. This is a major advantage, especially for mobile outdoor use. The connection between binoculars and adapter plate is made by two 1/4 inch threaded bolts (standard photo tripod thread), which are variably guided in a slotted hole. The double screw connection guarantees a very secure fit for the binoculars. The adapter plate itself is also attached to the U-mount by two large clamping screws, which are easy to use even when wearing gloves.<br>The Explore Scientific tripod provides a firm safe stand for the mount. The solid aluminium and stainless steel construction effectively suppresses most vibrations and the large 50mm diameter stainless steel tripod legs and the aluminium tripod head plate offer maximum stability with a moderate transport weight of only 5.8kg. With retracted tripod legs, the transport dimensions are only 80cm long (Adjustable working range 100 to 140cm.) The included accessory tray additionally gives some tension outwards to the tripod legs and therefore increases the stability even further.<br><strong>Explore Scientific U-Mount Features:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Solid fork mount with tripod for giant binoculars</li>\\n<li>Comfortable observation position in all orientations</li>\\n<li>Excellent mechanism for adjustment of tracking friction in both axis</li>\\n<li>Large hand wheels for adjustments - no problem even with gloves</li>\\n<li>Secure mounting of the binoculars in all adjustment positions</li>\\n<li>Integrated aluminium accessory tray</li>\\n<li>Carries binoculars up to 12kg</li>\\n<li>Adjustment range vertical axis: 0 to 90 degrees</li>\\n<li>Adjustment range azimuth axis: 360 degrees (without limitation)</li>\\n<li>Maximum possible width of the binoculars: 290mm</li>\\n<li>Quick change adapter plate with 2 x 1/4 inch photo thread screws</li>\\n<li>Double prismatic clamping of the quick-change adapter plate</li>\\n<li>Working height of tripod with the mount: approx. 100 to 140cm</li>\\n<li>Tripod leg tube diameter: 50mm</li>\\n<li>Transportation size tripod: approx 80cm length</li>\\n<li>Weight Mount/Tripod: 5.5kg / 5.8kg</li>\\n<li>Material Mount/Tripod: Aluminium / Stainless Steel</li>\\n<li>Shipping size/weight of Mount: 51 x 42 x 28cm, 7.6kg</li>\\n<li>Shipping size/weight of Tripod: 87 x 21 x 22cm, 6.5kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ol>\\n<li>U-Mount with field Tripod</li>\\n<li>Quick change adapter plate</li>\\n<li>Accessories tray</li>\\n<li>Instruction manual</li>\\n</ol>\\n', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000164-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 729.27, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ExploreScientificUMountforGiantAstronomyBinoculars_4.jpg?v=1648890530', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The comfortable 45 degree viewing angle allows fatigue-free use, even when the binoculars are tilted upwards towards the zenith. Large binoculars of this type can also be called a double refractor telescope because in this configuration, the full light gathering power of one single telescope is available to each eye. Experience a whole new dimension of observing as a consequence making the moon and stars appear like you can reach out and literally touch them - one of the main advantages that binoculars have over small basic telescopes.<br>These extremely robust binoculars have a magnesium housing, sealed and filled with nitrogen gas to prevent fogging and moisture on the inside of the optics. The BT series binoculars are designed for tough outdoor use. The very light magnesium housing saves weight and makes them easier to handle (however they do need to be\\xa0mounted on\\xa0a tripod due to their physical size). Two Explore Scientific 20mm eyepieces from the 62° LER series range are also included. However you can change the eyepieces to achieve higher magnification and almost any plug in type 1.25\" eyepieces are suitable.<br>You can even use standard 1.25\" colour or nebula filters which thread into the eyepiece for astronomical observations to further enhance your views of deep sky objects. However do keep in mind the use of eyepieces and colour / nebula filters must of course always be done in pairs.<br>The 45-degree viewing angle allows nice relaxed observation positions even when the binoculars are tilted towards the zenith. Also the individual interpupillary distance can be adjusted in a range from 54 to 76mm. With the fine helical individual focuser, precise focusing is achieved quite effortlessly. The integrated dew caps can also be removed in high humidity as well as cold conditions and even extended - This helps avoid fogging of the outer objective lenses and offers a barrier against stray light from the side.<br>A metal carrying handle located at the Bino\\'s center of gravity which facilitates transport and ensures a secure grasp during tripod assembly.

Also suitable for viewing nature and landscape during the day.</strong></p>\\n<p>These large, light-gathering lenses and professional grade coatings on all lens surfaces, ensure these binoculars produce bright and brilliant views all the time. The comfortable 45 degree viewing angle allows fatigue-free use, even when the binoculars are tilted upwards towards the zenith. Large binoculars of this type can also be called a double refractor telescope because in this configuration, the full light gathering power of one single telescope is available to each eye. Experience a whole new dimension of observing as a consequence making the moon and stars appear like you can reach out and literally touch them - one of the main advantages that binoculars have over small basic telescopes.<br>These extremely robust binoculars have a magnesium housing, sealed and filled with nitrogen gas to prevent fogging and moisture on the inside of the optics. The BT series binoculars are designed for tough outdoor use. The very light magnesium housing saves weight and makes them easier to handle (however they do need to be\\xa0mounted on\\xa0a tripod due to their physical size). Two Explore Scientific 20mm eyepieces from the 62° LER series range are also included. However you can change the eyepieces to achieve higher magnification and almost any plug in type 1.25\" eyepieces are suitable.<br>You can even use standard 1.25\" colour or nebula filters which thread into the eyepiece for astronomical observations to further enhance your views of deep sky objects. However do keep in mind the use of eyepieces and colour / nebula filters must of course always be done in pairs.<br>The 45-degree viewing angle allows nice relaxed observation positions even when the binoculars are tilted towards the zenith. Also the individual interpupillary distance can be adjusted in a range from 54 to 76mm. With the fine helical individual focuser, precise focusing is achieved quite effortlessly. The integrated dew caps can also be removed in high humidity as well as cold conditions and even extended - This helps avoid fogging of the outer objective lenses and offers a barrier against stray light from the side.<br>A metal carrying handle located at the Bino\\'s center of gravity which facilitates transport and ensures a secure grasp during tripod assembly. When using these large binoculars, a sturdy photo tripod with an appropriate load capacity is <br>required. The connection is made via two 1/4 inch or one 3/8 inch threaded holes (standard photo tripod thread) in the tripod adapter of the binoculars. <br><strong>Features:</strong> <br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Large binoculars for observing the night sky as well as landscape and nature</li>\\n<li>Observe globular star clusters, glowing gas nebulae, the moon with all its craters and even planets</li>\\n<li>High light gathering lenses produce a bright and high-contrast image</li>\\n<li>These are all-round binoculars, but they are especially suited for Astronomy</li>\\n<li>The comfortable 45 degree viewing angle allows fatigue-free use</li>\\n<li>Extremely robust binoculars with magnesium housing, sealed and filled with nitrogen.</li>\\n<li>Two Explore Scientific 20mm eyepieces are included</li>\\n<li>x20 magnification and an apparent field of view of 62°, true visible field of 3.1°</li>\\n<li>Large interpupillary distance of 15mm to the eyepiece lens for comfortable viewing</li>\\n<li>Eyepieces are interchangeable with standardized plug-in eyepieces of 1.25\" / 31.7mm</li>\\n<li>The magnification can be adjusted with optional eyepieces from x15 to x50</li>\\n<li>Precise brass eyepiece compression ring clamps for tilt-free fit</li>\\n<li>Color and nebula filters can be used for astronomical observations</li>\\n<li>Extendable dew caps prevent fogging of the outer objective lenses and stray light</li>\\n<li>Integrated carrying handle facilitates transport and mounting on the tripod</li>\\n<li>Tripod connection via two 1/4 inch or one 3/8 inch threaded holes (standard photo tripod thread)</li>\\n<li>Objective type: Air spaced achromatic lens (2 elements/ 1 group)</li>\\n<li>Coating: full multilayer coating on all optical surfaces</li>\\n<li>Aperture: 70mm</li>\\n<li>Focal length: 400mm</li>\\n<li>F ratio: f/5.7</li>\\n<li>Close focus distance: 12 meters</li>\\n<li>Adjustable interpupillary distance: 54 to 76 mm</li>\\n<li>Helical single focus: yes</li>\\n<li>BAK-4 prism system for a bright and high-contrast image</li>\\n<li>Dimensions:\\xa0370 x\\xa0213 x 122mm</li>\\n<li>Weight: 3.4kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>What\\'s included</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Giant binoculars with carrying handle (excl. tripod)</li>\\n<li>Eyepieces ES 20mm 62° LER Series (2pcs)</li>\\n<li>Dust covers for objectives and eyepiece sockets</li>\\n<li>Instruction manual</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p><em>SAFETY NOTICE:</em> <span>Never look directly at the Sun through your Binoculars or Telescope\\xa0- immediate and permanent eye damage may result.

Due to the square shape, it even allows the use of many larger telescopes without a corrector.</strong><br>A special feature of the ASI533MM Pro is the zero-amp glow circuit, which eliminates the amplifier glow that occurs with longer exposure times. This would brighten areas of the image at longer exposure times, particularly around the corners. The electronics are also designed to reduce the effect of external stray light, so you can take longer exposures under light-polluted skies.<br>One of the outstanding features of the ASI 533MM Pro is its sensational light sensitivity. The QE of 80% thanks to back illumination technology along with the very low amplifier glow make this camera very suitable for all astronomical applications, but especially for deep-sky astrophotography.<br><strong>Advantages and features of the ASI 533MM Pro camera:</strong><br><ul>\\n<li>USB 3.0 for fast download - can also be used with USB 2.0</li>\\n<li>DDR3 memory buffer for stable data transfer with USB2.0 - This minimizes amplifier glow</li>\\n<li>Powerful Peltier cooling up to 35°C below ambient conditions</li>\\n<li>One of Sony´s most light-sensitive CMOS sensors</li>\\n<li>High resolution by 3.76 µm pixels - ideal for fast and sharp telescopes like APO\\'s, Hyperstar, Celestron Faststar, Newtonian telescopes etc.</li>\\n<li>Supplied with AR clear glass filter - full transmission also in infrared. If the IR is to be blocked, an IR cut filter is required.</li>\\n<li>Distance T2 connection thread (female thread) to camera sensor: 17.5 mm</li>\\n<li>Distance front surface to sensor (using male thread): only 6.5 mm</li>\\n<li>High sensitivity - QE over 80% - ideal astronomy camera for low-light objects</li>\\n<li>14-bit ADC. Similar depth to CCD cameras, but with a much higher sensitivity.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Application areas of the camera:</em><br><strong>Deep-sky images (nebulae and galaxies):</strong> <br>Due to the high sensitivity, nebulae and galaxies are imaged after only a few seconds. The camera can be cooled up to 35°C below ambient temperature. By raising the Gain level (comparable to the ISO setting for digital SLR cameras), you can reduce exposure times to less than 30 seconds. Effects caused by air turbulence or inaccuracies in tracking are therefore dramatically reduced.<br><strong>Lunar and planetary images:</strong> <br>Extremely short exposure times due to high sensitivity freeze the air turbulence. Due to the high resolution of the sensor, many details can be imaged even with a shorter telescope focal length. Video \\'Lucky Imaging\\' astrophotography is also possible.<br><strong>Back illumination technology:</strong><br>Sony\\'s back-illuminated CMOS image sensor improves sensitivity and noise reduction, which are the key factors to enhancing image quality. This retains the advantages of traditional CMOS image sensors such as low power consumption and high-speed operation.<br>This allows significantly shorter exposure times and leads to an improved quantum efficiency of 80%.<br><strong>Zero amp glow:</strong><br>Traditional CMOS sensors produce a weak infrared light source during operation quite often seen in the corner of uncalibrated images as the tell tale signs of \\'amp glow\\'. As the ASI533MM Pro uses zero amp glow circuitry, you won\\'t have to worry about amp glow even when using high gain, long exposure imaging.<br><em>Important: external power supply required!</em><br>Please notice that all ZWO cameras with a cooler need to be connected to an external 11-15 V power supply to work. Even when the cooler is not being used the power supply must be used for the camera to operate.<br>Good storage is an important factor in the prevention against dew and also extends the life span of the camera. Always ensure your camera is stored in a cool dry place and any excess moisture from dew or frost is removed.<br><strong>Features:</strong>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Sensor: Sony Mono IMX533 square back-illuminated CMOS</li>\\n<li>Sensor size: 11.31mm x 11.31mm - 15.97mm diagonal</li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 3.76 µm</li>\\n<li>Pixel number: 9 megapixels, 3008x3008</li>\\n<li>ADC: 14 bit</li>\\n<li>Cooling: Powerful Peltier cooling</li>\\n<li>Full well: 50ke</li>\\n<li>Readout noise: 1.0 to 3.8e</li>\\n<li>Sensitivity: Peak 80% QE</li>\\n<li>Frame rate at maximum resolution: approx. 20fps (approx. 54fps at Full HD)</li>\\n<li>Power consumption: 12V, 3A</li>\\n<li>Telescope connection: M42x0.75 female thread</li>\\n<li>Protection glass: D32-2-AR protection glass with full IR transmission</li>\\n<li>Working distance from female thread to sensor: 17.5mm</li>\\n<li>Height of the thread adapter ring: 11mm</li>\\n<li>Working distance from front surface to sensor: 6.5mm</li>\\n<li>Diameter: 78mm</li>\\n<li>Weight: 470 g</li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<div><em>Whats included:</em></div>\\n<div>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Camera with 11mm high thread adapter<br></li>\\n<li>1.25\" connector<br></li>\\n<li>USB 2.0 cable (0.5 meter)<br></li>\\n<li>USB 3.0 cable (2 meters)<br></li>\\n<li>T2 M48 adapter - length 16.5mm<br></li>\\n<li>T2 extension - length 21mm<br></li>\\n<li>Adapter from M48 to T2 without effective length<br></li>\\n<li>Adapter T2 to 1.25\" filter thread without effective length (for example for filters<br></li>\\n<li>4x spacer rings</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000199-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 1619.69, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ASI533MCP_4_67451e78-3b41-4cf1-be2c-7f352f4d0169.jpg?v=1664785321', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

Due to the pixel size of only 2.4 µm, the resolution of this camera is sensational. </strong></div>\\n\\n<div>One of the outstanding features of the ASI183 is the sensational light sensitivity. It has a QE of 84%, due to the Back Illumination technology, and the very low amplifier glow make the camera very well suited for all astronomical applications, but above all for deep-sky astrophotography.<br>This \"single shot\" color camera offers several advantages compared with monochrome cameras. Many imagers prefer not to follow through the laborious L-RGB technique for beautiful colored nebula or planetary images. Color cameras offer a the chance to obtain beautiful images in fewer sessions and without having to constantly change filters. Compared to a standard DSLR camera, the ASI183MC offers much higher light sensitivity, a smoother image and much more depth.<br><em>Additional Features:</em><br><ul>\\n<li>USB 3.0 for quick download - can also be used with USB 2.0</li>\\n<li>DDR3 memory buffer to help improve data transfer reliability. Additionally, the use of a memory buffer minimizes amp-glow, which is caused by the slow transfer speeds when the camera is used with a USB 2.0 port.</li>\\n<li>Powerful Peltier cooling up to 45°C below ambient.</li>\\n<li>One of the most light-sensitive CMOS sensors from Sony with 15.9mm diagonal and 20 megapixels</li>\\n<li>Extremely high resolution thanks to the 2.4µm pixels - ideal for fast and sharp telescopes like Apos, Hyperstar, Celestron Faststar, fast Newtonian telescopes etc.</li>\\n<li>Comes with AR protect window - full transmission also in infrared.

By cooling down the camera up to 45°C below ambient, the already low levels of noise can be further reduced. By increasing gain (like the ISO setting of DSLR cameras), you can also reduce exposure times to below 30 seconds if necessary<br>Solar, lunar and planetary images: Extremely short exposure times (due to high sensitivity) freeze the seeing. Through the high resolution of the sensor, many details can be reproduced even at shorter focal length. Video capture is also possible.<br><strong>Important: An external power supply is required!</strong><br>Please notice that all ZWO cameras with cooler need to be connected to an external 11-15 V power supply to work. Even when the cooler is not being used the power supply must be used for the camera to be reliably recognized by the software.<br><strong>Spec:</strong><br><ul>\\n<li>Sensor: 1″ CMOS IMX183CLK-J/CQJ-J</li>\\n<li>Resolution: 20.18 megapixels, 5496 x 3672</li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 2.4µm</li>\\n<li>Sensor diagonal: 13.2mm x 8.8mm, 15.9mm diagonal</li>\\n<li>Exposure time: 32µs to 2000s</li>\\n<li>Readout noise: 1.6 e- @30dB gain</li>\\n<li>Full well: 15 ke-</li>\\n<li>Quantum efficiency maximal: Approx. 84%</li>\\n<li>Frame rate: 19 FPS @maximum resolution</li>\\n<li>Cooling: Peltier cooling up to 45°C below ambient</li>\\n<li>Software requirements: USB3.0 and USB2.0</li>\\n<li>DDRIII Buffer: 256 MB</li>\\n<li>Bit rate: 12 bit output (12 bit ADC)</li>\\n<li>Telescope connection: T2, 2\" and 1.25\"</li>\\n<li>Distance T2-thread (female) to sensor: 17.5mm (6.5mm without adapter)</li>\\n<li>Dimensions: 78 mm diameter and 86 mm length</li>\\n<li>Weight: 410g</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ol>\\n<li><em>ASI Cooled Camera, with 11mm T2 Ring</em></li>\\n<li><em>Camera bag</em></li>\\n<li><em>USB 3.0 cable, 2m</em></li>\\n<li><em>Quick Guide (English)</em></li>\\n<li><em>T2 extension (21mm long)</em></li>\\n<li><em>M48 to T2 adapter (16.5mm long)</em></li>\\n<li><em>Adapter from T2 to 1.25\" socket with filter thread</em></li>\\n<li><em>Dust cap 1.25\"</em></li>\\n<li><em>M42-M48 adapter (without optical path)</em></li>\\n<li><em>2x USB 2.0 cable, 0.5m</em></li>\\n<li><em>Flat adapter T2 to 1.25\" thread (without optical path)</em></li>\\n<li><em>4x spacer rings</em></li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000202-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 1169.95, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ZWOASI183MCAstroCamera.jpg?v=1666708086', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The extremely high sensitivity is achieved thanks to the SONY back illumination technology. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred within seconds, reducing the need for high buffering or delay times.<br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope via female T2 thread (M42, 0.75mm) or via the supplied 2\" (50.8 mm) plug-in adapter and then install the drivers as required and you\\'re ready to go.<br>The included EXPLORE Capture professional software not only offers the necessary basic functions for image and video recording, but also includes many special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Features such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, timelapse shooting and much more can be individually configured.<br>This Explore Scientific Deep Sky Astro camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise SONY EXMOR IMX-571 APS-C CMOS sensor, which can be additionally cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. This guarantees far less noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots compared to normal DSLR cameras. As a result, your images are not only much sharper and detailed, but simply containmore usable image information for post processing. Due to the controlled setting of the desired camera temperature, <br>dark frames can be created at any time after the imaging session. The large-format CMOS sensor with a diagonal of 28.3mm also allows a wider image FOV and greatly simplifies the setting and centering of objects.<br>The backlit EXMOR CMOS sensor increases quantum efficiency up to 80% at 533nm, which means an extremely high luminous efficiancy and therefore particularly bright and high-contrast photos.<br>The camera also has a built-in USB hub on the back with 2 x USB 2.0 ports. This allows you to Connect additional accessories such as an autoguider camera or auto-focusser etc. via short USB cable and thus reduce the risk of Cable clutter and cable breaks.<br>A sturdy hard case is also included for the camera.<br><em>Field of view for different focal lengths in arc minutes and degrees:</em><br><ul>\\n<li>400mm - 201 ́ x 135 ́ (3.4 x 2.3 degrees)</li>\\n<li>500mm - 161 ́ x 108 ́ (2.7 x 1.8 degrees)</li>\\n<li>600mm - 134 ́ x 90 ́ (2.2 x 1.5 degrees)</li>\\n<li>700mm - 115 ́ x 77 ́ (1.9 x 1.3 degrees)</li>\\n<li>800mm - 100 ́ x 67 ́ (1.7 x 1.1 degrees)</li>\\n<li>900mm - 89 ́ x 60 ́ (1.5 x 1.0 degrees)</li>\\n<li>1000mm - 80 ́ x 54 ́ (1.3 x 0.9 degrees)</li>\\n<li>1250mm - 64 ́ x 43 ́ (1.1 x 0.7 degrees)</li>\\n<li>1500mm - 53 ́ x 36 ́ (0.9 x 0.6 degrees)</li>\\n<li>1750mm - 46 ́ x 31 ́ (0.8 x 0.5 degrees)</li>\\n<li>2000mm - 40 ́ x 27 ́ (0.7 x 0.45 degrees)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<strong>Camera Specification:</strong><br><ul>\\n<li>Camera Type: ASTRO Color Camera 26.0MP ATR3CMOS26000KPA</li>\\n<li>Data output: single images and video</li>\\n<li>Image Sensor: SONY EXMOR IMX-571 CMOS Color Sensor</li>\\n<li>Adjustable resolution: 6224x4168 / 3104x2084 / 2064x1386</li>\\n<li>Adjustable Binning: 1x1/2x2/3x3</li>\\n<li>Frame Rate Per Second (FBS): 6.8 / 28 / 63</li>\\n<li>Physical sensor size in pixels: 6224 x 4168</li>\\n<li>Megapixels: 26MP</li>\\n<li>Sensor size: 23.48 x 15.67mm (APS-C format)</li>\\n<li>Screen diagonal: 28.3mm</li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 3.76 μm x 3.76μm</li>\\n<li>Bit depth: 8 bit / 16 bit</li>\\n<li>Flange distance: 17.5mm</li>\\n<li>Closure Type: Rolling Shutter</li>\\n<li>Internal camera memory: 512 MB DDR 3 RAM</li>\\n<li>Thermoelectric cooling with fan: Yes, up to 40°C below ambient</li>\\n<li>Adjustable exposure times: 150μs to 60min</li>\\n<li>Operating temperature: -10 to +50°C (30-80% RH)</li>\\n<li>Cable length USB 3.0: 150cm</li>\\n<li>DC cable length power supply: 200cm</li>\\n<li>CNC machined housing made of aluminum</li>\\n<li>Camera diameter: 80mm; length: 102mm</li>\\n<li>Camera weight: 0.53kg</li>\\n<li>Camera connector diameter: 2.0 inches (50.8mm)</li>\\n<li>Camera connection thread: T2 (M42x0.75mm)</li>\\n<li>Filter thread: Yes, 2.0 inch in receptacle</li>\\n<li>Camera connection to PC: USB 3.0</li>\\n<li>Built-in USB hub with 2 x USB 2.0 ports</li>\\n<li>Power supply: Power supply 12 volts 3.0 amps included</li>\\n<li>Software: EXPLORE Capture included</li>\\n<li>Camera driver and ASCOM driver included</li>\\n<li>Operating System: WINDOWS 10 + 11</li>\\n<li>PC Requirements: CPU Intel Core2 2.8 Ghz or higher / 2 GB Ram / USB 3.0</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br><em>Whats included:</em><br><ol>\\n<li>Deep Sky Astro Camera 26MP</li>\\n<li>Plug-in adapter T2 thread to 2.0\" (50.8 mm)</li>\\n<li>USB 3.0 connection cable 150cm</li>\\n<li>Power supply 230V / 12V 3.0A</li>\\n<li>Dust cap for camera opening</li>\\n<li>Software CD</li>\\n<li>Hard Case</li>\\n<li>Operating instructions</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n\\n<div>\\n<div><span><strong>DOWNLOAD YOUR CAMERA SOFTWARE &amp; MANUAL HERE:</strong></span></div>\\n<div>\\n<ol>\\n<li><span>Download the Astro Cam ASCOM &amp; Software Drivers\\xa0<a>here</a></span></li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000206-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 1619.69, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/products/ExploreScientific26MPDeepSkyAstroCamera_9.jpg?v=1670175504', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

This makes it possible to observe together in a group on a computer screen for example.<br><strong>Use as autoguider:</strong><br>The ASI662MC is a lightweight with only 126 grams and offers the ST-4 autoguiding interface. A 2 meter long autoguiding cable is also included.<br><strong>AR-coated clear glass filter protects the sensor from dust:</strong><br>The clear glass filter prevents dust from getting to the sensor. It also lets UV and infrared through, so you can also do infrared photography with the camera. You have full control over what light hits the sensor with the right choice of contrast filters, nebula filters, IR pass filters, or UV/IR blocking filters.<br><strong>Air cooling - reduces sensor temperature:</strong><br>The sensor heats up during the exposures. The PCS dissipates heat from the sensor via a heat conducting pad. The sensor temperature is thus reduced by up to 15 degrees Celsius compared to cameras without PCS.<br><strong>Very high sensitivity for short exposure times:</strong><br>One advantage of the back-illuminated CMOS sensor is the lower readout noise and improved sensitivity. In particular, Sony uses STARVIS-2 technology in the IMX662 sensor, which provides excellent low-light visibility. You can achieve a very high light output in astro imaging and realize high image quality not only in visible light, but also in the near infrared range (to reduce seeing). In addition, the low readout noise and the high full-well capacity ensure a higher dynamic range.<br>The ASI662MC is not only ideal for Planetary and Lunar imaging, but can also be used as a live streaming camera or as an all-sky camera for observing or monitoring weather conditions.<br><strong>The HCG mode:</strong><br>The camera has a built-in HCG mode that can effectively reduce readout noise at high gain and maintain the same wide dynamic range that you would expect at low gain. When the gain is 150, the HCG mode will turn on automatically. This results in readout noise below 1.45 e- while the dynamic range can still reach almost 12.5 f-stops.<br><strong>Camera Specification:</strong><br><ul>\\n<li>Sensor: Sony 1/2.8\" CMOS IMX662AAQR-C color sensor</li>\\n<li>Resolution: 1920*1080 pixels, 2.07 megapixels</li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 2.9 μm</li>\\n<li>Sensor size: 5.568mm x 3.132mm</li>\\n<li>Diagonal: 6.45mm (1/2.8\")</li>\\n<li>Capture speed: up to 107.6 FPS at 10 bit</li>\\n<li>Exposure time: from 32 μs - 2000 s</li>\\n<li>ROI: Supported</li>\\n<li>ST4 autoguider port: Yes</li>\\n<li>Distance from T2 thread to sensor: 12.5mm</li>\\n<li>Shutter type: Rolling shutter</li>\\n<li>Protective window: AR coated, full IR transmission</li>\\n<li>Connection: USB3.0/USB2.0</li>\\n</ul>\\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ol>\\n<li>ASI camera</li>\\n<li>Adapter T2 (M42x0.75) on 1.25\" 1.25\"</li>\\n<li>Adapter T2 to CS mount (mounted) Wide field lens (mounted)</li>\\n<li>USB 3.0 cable ST4 cable</li>\\n<li>Quick Start Guide</li>\\n</ol>\\n<strong>Software Download:</strong><br>Drivers and programs for this camera can be downloaded from the following link - <a>HERE</a>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000233-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 434.55, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/ZWO-ASI662MC_3.jpg?v=1696397024', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

This well loved telescope series even provides good portability due to its lightweight fibreglass telescope tube and optics of this size offer some of the best views you will see of our Solar System and beyond.</strong></p>\\n<p>Thanks to the powerful telescope aperture of 305mm, you get significantly more light-gathering capacity than with the smaller models and are therefore not limited to observing the moon and the planets of our solar system - you can already look far out into the universe and observe globular clusters, nebulae and galaxies with even greater brightness. Details become visible in most deep-sky objects: globular clusters are clearly resolved into individual stars and gas nebulae, which can only be guessed at with smaller devices, show structure.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>The device is unrivalled in its versatility: The excellent large Hexafoc focuser has an aperture of 65mm - so there is no noticeable obstruction from the focuser tube even with large wide-field eyepieces.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Thanks to the large altitude wheels, even these heavier eyepieces are held effortlessly. And if a particularly large number of accessories is attached, such as a binocular attachment, then the entire tube can be moved inside the tube clamps - and everything is balanced again in a flash. The unrivalled rigidity of the focuser makes focusing very easy - so photography with this telescope is also possible.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>This is another strength of this universal telescope: if you want to take photos, you can simply unscrew the altitude wheels from the tube and attach it to an equatorial mount using a dovetail bar - so there\\'s nothing standing in the way of astrophotography. An optional 10:1 gear reduction for the focuser is available for the highest demands. Considering that the focuser is the most frequently used part of the telescope, the use of the Hexafoc in this device is a quantum leap for this price range.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>In addition, the new 12\" Bresser Messier makes it easy to transport the device as compactly as possible - the rocker box can be dismantled in a few simple steps because the parts are assembled with metal quick-release connectors. This quickly turns a bulky rocker box into a handy flat package of individual parts. This really is a telescope whose versatility, performance and user-friendliness set new standards in this price class.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>The package also includes a high-quality objective solar filter for safe observation of sunspots, eclipses and planetary transits.</p>\\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Type: Reflector telescope\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope for night and solar observation<br></li>\\n<li>Lightweight but very stable GRP telescope tube<br></li>\\n<li>Primary mirror diameter: 12\" (305 mm) parabolic main mirror\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Focal length: 1,525 mm\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture ratio: f/5</li>\\n<li>Maximum useful magnification: 610x\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Theoretical. resolving power: 0.45 arcseconds\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Easy to balance the tube by sliding it inside the tube rings<br></li>\\n<li>Visual limiting magnitude: 14.5 mag\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Tube: GRP tube with adjustable tube rings and aluminium altitude bearings\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Focuser: 2.5\" HEXAFOC focuser with 2\" and 1 1/4\" adapter\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Shifting-free focusing even with heavy accessories\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror bracket: very thin 4-arm steel spider\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Tube rings and altitude wheels made from aluminum<br></li>\\n<li>Different sized adjustment and counter screws on the mirror cell\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Use of the optics also on EQ mounts (with optional dovetail bar)\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Mount: Dobsonian system\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Dismantlable rocker box\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Accessory tray for one 2\" and two 1 1/4\" eyepieces, mounted on the front side\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Eyepiece: BRESSER Super Plössl 25 mm (1 1/4\")\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Viewfinder: 6x30 viewfinder<br></li>\\n<li>Hybrid viewfinder shoes (Art. 0620158) included (2 pcs)<br></li>\\n<li>Tube weight without accessories: 16 kg<br></li>\\n<li>Tube weight with accessories: 18.9 kg\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Rocker box weight: 14.8 kg\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Total weight: 33.7 kg\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Overall dimensions: 60 x 60 x 163 cm</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats</em><em>\\xa0included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Reflector Tube with Newtonian optics\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture solar filter\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>6x30 viewfinder\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Hybrid viewfinder shoes (2 pcs)<br></li>\\n<li>25mm Super-Plössl eyepiece (Ø 31.7mm / 1.25\")\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>1 extension tube 37.5mm for 2.5\" Hexafoc\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>1 eyepiece adapter Ø 31.7 to 50.8mm\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>2 tube rings\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>2 altitude wheels\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Rocker box with 2 base plates and mounting material (disassembled for self-assembly)\\xa0</li>\\n</ol>\\n ', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000250-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 1281.36, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Bresser_Messier_305mm_Dobsonian_Telescope_7.jpg?v=1720463111', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'Vixen Sphinx SX2 WL German Equatorial Mount', 'Type': 'Astrophotography Payload > 12kg', 'Body (HTML)': \"<p><strong>Vixen has developed a new generation of SX mounts designed for demanding observers and astrophotographers.</strong></p>\\n<p>The SX2WL mount is an ideal solution for both beginners and advanced Astronomers looking for a lightweight, reliable and precise mount. It is simply operated via a Wifi module with a smartphone or tablet and by controlling the mount with your smartphone using the free Star Book Wireless app, you can easily use sky navigation functions such as automatic GoTo panning of celestial objects via your smartphone or tablet. By eliminating the power consumption of the conventional LCD (Starbook Ten), the power consumption on the mount is reduced by up to 20%, thus enabling longer astronomical observation and astrophotography.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>When the desired celestial object is selected from a list, it is automatically panned into the telescope's field of view and tracking begins. Note: An existing Star Book Ten controller can also be used on this mount without any problems.\\xa0<br>The mount is equipped with the same precision stepper motors as the top model - the AXD mount, the SXD2WL brings a new standard of performance and precision to the Vixen mount family.</p>\\n<p>With a photographic load capacity of 12 kg, the axis cross of the mount weighs just 7.0 kg (15.4 lbs) making it ideal for mobile observations. In addition, the motors mounted in the lower part of the mount also serve as a counterweight, so the mount requires fewer weights for balancing.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>The SX2 mount in detail:<br></strong>Precision stepper motors and micro-step motion control system.\\xa0At the heart of the SXD2 are the precision stepper motors, which offer better performance and response than previous models. The micro-step motion control system offers powerful and yet very smooth drive characteristics, which are given both in fine movements and in fast pans.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Built-in bearings:</strong><br>The bearings of the RA and DEC axes and the worm shafts have been significantly improved to reduce the load on the motors. As a result, the motors move much more smoothly than in previous models.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>High-precision worm gears:</strong><br>High-precision processing technologies eliminate worm gear errors. The edges of the two worms and worm wheels are particularly smooth, enabling very precise tracking.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Declination axis as counterweight:</strong><br>The solid motor units are installed in the lower part of the declination axis so that the center of gravity of the SXD2 is below the intersection point of the RA and DEC axes. This means you need fewer additional counterweights.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Latitude setting:</strong><br>The latitude is adjustable between 0 and 70 degrees (divided into 3 zones and adjustable +/- 15 degrees per zone, for high, medium and low latitudes); latitude scale in 2-degree increments; fine adjustment with a tangent screw head, approx. 0.8 degrees per turn.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>The wireless module in detail :<br></strong>The Vixen Wifi adapter for EQ mounts allows you to control your Vixen mount via a smartphone or tablet. With the smartphone app Star Book Wireless (free of charge) you can navigate the sky without any cables. The app turns your smartphone or tablet into a control unit for the equatorial mount in no time at all. The response delay of the mount, which is considered the biggest disadvantage of wireless connections, has been reduced to a level comparable to wired connections.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Reduced power consumption compared to conventional controllers with LCD monitor\\xa0<br>The power consumption of the mount is reduced by up to 20%, allowing longer observations than with conventional wired controllers such as the Starbook Ten\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Operation similar to the Star Book Ten controller:</strong><br>The Star Book Wireless app has a similar structure to the Star Book Ten controller. Depending on the star map setting, it contains up to 259,000 celestial objects. Tap on a celestial object in the object list and start the GoTo. The mount will now automatically move to this target and bring it into the telescope's field of view. All the popular features of the Star Book Ten are retained.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Convenient operation:</strong><br>When looking through the telescope operate the mount by swiping on the app's star chart. As there are no buttons, simply slide your finger over the star chart to operate the mount conveniently.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Extensive astronomical data included:</strong><br>In addition to data on easily observable celestial bodies such as Messier objects, NGC objects and IC objects, this also includes the sun, moon, planets, comets and dwarf planets.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>High-precision alignment:</strong><br>By aligning the mount to one or two stars, you can already achieve fairly precise positioning. By aligning the mount to three or more stars, you can achieve high-precision alignment of the mount for high magnifications. The objects are then approached precisely and centrally in your telescope's field of view. The alignment information is saved and can be retained even when the device is switched off. By leaving the telescope in its current state after completing an observation without moving it, you can start the automatic installation with the same settings for the next observation. \\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Individ</strong><span><strong>ual setting options:</strong><br></span><span>As with the Star Book Ten control unit, the app offers various individual settings, such as gear backlash compensation, night mode in red, autoguider and variable GoTo speed and LED brightness. You can also set the timing of the reversal of the objective tube (meridian flip) as desired. Even if the object moves to the south during tracking, you can prevent the telescope tube from reversing.\\xa0</span><br></p>\\n<p><strong>Important note: Cannot be used on old SX mounts with the old blue Star Book!\\xa0</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Technical information about the Wifi module: </strong>CPU with 32-bit CISC processor 120 MHz.\\xa0The unit is connected to the mount via a D-SUB 9PIN connector as with the STAR BOOK TEN.

As a pure mirror system, you can even use the infrared light. You can achieve up to 25% shorter exposure times and sharper imaging than, for example, through a comparable Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. For the use of a reflex camera without focal length reduction you need the 50mm and the 25mm extension between focuser and telescope.</p>\\n<p>The generous backfocus also allows the connection of correctors (which we recommend for the use of full-frame sensors). You can also connect a focal length reducer, thus further increasing the light intensity of the Ritchey-Chrétien.</p>\\n<p><strong>Accessories - 0.67x CCD reducer for Astrophotography:<br></strong>The <a>CCD47 reducer</a> improves the focal ratio from f/8 to f/5.36, thus reducing the exposure time to less than 50%. With this, you can capture dim nebulae and galaxies with more moderate exposure times.</p>\\n<p><strong>The advantages of a carbon tube over a metal tube:<br></strong>The weight reduction is minimal - only about 300 grams - the main advantage is the focus stability when temperature changes which is important for Astrophotography. When temperatures drop, metal contracts and the focus moves meaning refocusing is necessary. A carbon tube does not change, the combination of quartz glass mirror and carbon composite tube makes a readjustment of the sharpness obsolete, even for long time exposures.</p>\\n<p><strong>The 2\" Monorail focuser:<br></strong>The Monorail focuser combines the ease of movement of a Crayford focuser with the stiffness of a rack-and-pinion focuser.</p>\\n<p><em>Focuser Features:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\xa0A stainless steel bar instead of small ball bearings for more stiffness.<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa0No tilting anymore when locking the drawtube.<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa0360° rotation for optimal object alignment<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa0Female M69 x 1 thread for threaded adaptions<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa02\" and 1.25\" compression rings for push adaptions<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa01:10 dual speed for accurate focusing<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa0Motor focus can easily retrofitted<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa0Lined scale for quick retrieving of the focus.<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa0Easy operation</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optical Design: True Ritchey-Chrétien design with a hyperbolic primary and secondary mirror<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture: 203mm / 8\"<br></li>\\n<li>Focal length: 1624mm (1088mm using the <a>CCD47 Reducer</a>)<br></li>\\n<li>Focal ratio: f/8 (f/5.36 with the <a>CCD47 Reducer</a>)<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 0.58\"<br></li>\\n<li>Reflectivity: 94% enhanced reflectivity<br></li>\\n<li>Back focus: 254mm from the tube´s backside or 159mm from the 2\" receptacle of the focuser<br></li>\\n<li>Tube Diameter: 230mm<br></li>\\n<li>Tube Length: 580mm with focuser<br></li>\\n<li>Weight: 7.6kg with focuser and dovetails<br></li>\\n<li>Tube Material: Carbon composite with internal baffles<br></li>\\n<li>Total Obstruction by Secondary: 85mm<br></li>\\n<li>Focuser: 2\" dual speed Monorail<br></li>\\n<li>Connection Thread: M90 x 1<br></li>\\n<li>Dovetail Bars: 1x GP, 1x Losmandy style, each 395mm long</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\xa08\" f/8 RC Astrograph<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa02\" dual speed Monorail focuser\\xa0</li>\\n<li>2 x Dovetail<br></li>\\n<li>\\xa0M90 extension tubes for easy reaching of the focus<br></li>\\n<li>Collimation manual</li>\\n</ol>\\n ', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000256-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 1569.05, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/TS-RC8-Telescope_6_a038c1cb-e09b-4965-9923-d5d36ac14c58.jpg?v=1721487726', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

For the use of a reflex camera without focal length reduction you need the 50mm and the 25mm extension between focuser and telescope.</p>\\n<p>The generous backfocus also allows the connection of correctors (which we recommend for the use of full-frame sensors). You can also connect a focal length reducer, thus further increasing the light intensity of the Ritchey-Chrétien.</p>\\n<p><strong>Accessories - 0.67x CCD reducer for Astrophotography:</strong><br>The <a>CCD47 reducer</a> improves the focal ratio from f/9 to f/5.96, therefore reducing the exposure time by around 50%. With this, you can capture dim nebulae and galaxies with more moderate exposure times.</p>\\n<p><strong>Primary and secondary mirror of quartz glass with 94% enhanced reflectivity:</strong><br>Quartz glass does not change its dimensions if temperature changes. When the temperature changes slowly during an exposure, other mirror substrates, like Pyrex, tend to a deformation of the mirror and thus to a shift of the focus. This problem does not exist for mirrors of quartz glass. Therefore the focus is better maintained which is very important for long exposures. Both mirrors are coated with 94% reflectivity material which means the image is obviously brighter than many other designs with only 90% reflection.</p>\\n<p><strong>The advantages of TS Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes for Astrophotography:</strong><br>The TS RC astrographs are true Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes. Maksutovs and Schmidt-Cassegrains have spherical mirrors and need correctors for making a large field usable. With Schmidt-Cassegrains, you can see the aberrations in the field even when working visually. Most times, Maksutov-Cassegrains are so slow that they are not suitable for astrophotography. RC telescopes have hyperbolical primary and secondary mirrors. They are more difficult to manufacture, but offer a significantly sharper field with less aberrations throughout the field.</p>\\n<p><strong>What makes the Ritchey-Chrétien Telescope superior to Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes for Astrophotography:</strong><br>Schmidt-Cassegrains generally require a corrector for Astrophotography. Additionally, these telescopes have a Schmidt plate at the front side which is prone to dew. The RC is a pure reflection system without lenses in the light path. Thus you can use the complete light even in the infrared range. The image is brighter and the exposure times get shorter. The field of an RC telescope is coma-free by design and relatively flat.</p>\\n<p><strong>No shifting problem with TS RC telescopes:</strong><br>Telescopes with focusing via a movable primary mirror often suffer from mirror shifting problems. The image shifts while focusing or even jumps. TS Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes do not have this problem, as their primary mirror is fixed. Focusing is done via a high-quality focuser. An additional advantage is the optimal distance from primary to secondary mirror which gives you the guarantee of the best possible image if the primary mirror moves relative to the secondary, you will almost never have the optimal distance.</p>\\n<p><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optical Design: True Ritchey-Chrétien with a hyperbolic primary and secondary mirror.<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture: 6\" / 154mm<br></li>\\n<li>Focal Length: 1370mm (918mm using the <a>CCD47 Reducer</a>)<br></li>\\n<li>Focal Ratio: f/9 (f/5.96 using the <a>CCD47 reducer</a>)<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 0.76\"<br></li>\\n<li>Reflectivity: 94% reflectivity non-tarnishing mirror coatings<br></li>\\n<li>Back Focus: 159mm from 2\" connection of the focuser<br></li>\\n<li>Tube Diameter: 191mm<br></li>\\n<li>Tube Length: 500mm with focuser<br></li>\\n<li>Tube Weight: 5.4kg<br></li>\\n<li>Obstruction by secondary: 77mm<br></li>\\n<li>Focuser: 2\" dual speed Crayford focuser<br></li>\\n<li>Connecting Thread: M90x1<br></li>\\n<li>Dovetail Bar: 1x GP style</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>What\\'s included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>6\" f/9 RC Astrograph<br></li>\\n<li>2\" Crayford focuser with 1.25\" adaptor<br></li>\\n<li>Vixen style dovetail bar<br></li>\\n<li>M90 Extension rings 1x 50mm and 2x 25mm<br></li>\\n<li>Dust cover</li>\\n</ol>\\n ', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000257-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 647.28, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/TS-RC6-Telescope_1.jpg?v=1721502409', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

So, look forward to a stable yet easily portable mount, which despite its light weight of only 16kg (incl. tripod), allows for a high load capacity of up to 25kg.</p>\\n<p><strong>Visual Observation:</strong><br>For visual observation and direct use, control the mount with the hand control box included in the package. Alternatively, connect the Nebula 6 via WLAN directly to your smartphone or tablet and use the virtual hand control box. Of course, all adjustment parameters can also be set via the web application. The user interface is deliberately made simple and clear to ensure intuitive operation.</p>\\n<p><strong>Astrophotography:</strong><br>This is where the Nebula 6 mount shows its full strength. Whether mobile or stationary, the capability for remote operation is crucial. Connect your laptop or PC either via WLAN or with an Ethernet cable (recommended for faster data transmission) directly to the Raspberry-Pi control unit of the mount. Then use the pre-installed Kstars/EKOS software to control the mount and all external devices such as cameras, motor focus, filter wheel, etc. Alternatively, you can also directly control the unit with your own software. Applications such as Cart du Ciel (Star Chart), The Sky X, Sky Safari, Stellarium, and other planetarium programs as well as SGP, Nina, CCD Ciel, and other astrophotography tools can be used without any issues.</p>\\n<p><strong>2-in-1 Mount with EQ and AZ Mode:</strong><br>If required, the Nebula can be switched from the equatorial mode to the azimuthal mode. This is particularly advantageous for tracking satellites. Therefore, the mount can be used for various applications and is not limited to long exposure astrophotography.</p>\\n<p>Attachment of up to two optics:<br>Would you like to adapt multiple optics? No problem. Simply use the option to replace the counterweight bar with another telescope. Use the second optic as a counterweight to the main telescope. Set the Nebula 5 to azimuthal mode, remove the counterweight bar, and screw a suitable second telescope clamp directly onto the mount.</p>\\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Precise and quiet telescope mount – ideal for astrophotography<br></li>\\n<li>Extensive connectivity options for various accessories via USB<br></li>\\n<li>Integrated web app software enables central control of all components<br></li>\\n<li>Integrated Raspberry Pi with USB-3 ports and Ethernet port<br></li>\\n<li>Compatible with client applications such as Cart du Ciel (Star Chart), The Sky X, Sky Safari, Stellarium<br></li>\\n<li>Compatible with SGP, Nina, CCD Ciel, and other astrophotography tools<br></li>\\n<li>Virtual hand control box and settings menu for smartphones and tablets<br></li>\\n<li>PC control – ASCOM and INDI compatible<br></li>\\n<li>USB ports for cameras, motors, filter wheels, etc.<br></li>\\n<li>Conversion from parallactic to azimuthal mode possible<br></li>\\n<li>Small hand box for basic functions included<br></li>\\n<li>Mount CNC-manufactured from stainless steel and aluminium<br></li>\\n<li>Tooth belt drive for precise and quiet tracking<br></li>\\n<li>Load capacity: 18kg in EQ mode and 25kg in AZ mode<br></li>\\n<li>Dual prism clamping for Vixen GP and Losmandy<br></li>\\n<li>Weight of the mount: 11kg<br></li>\\n<li>Weight of the tripod: 5kg<br></li>\\n<li>Max Tripod height - 103cm</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Nebula 6 EQ/AZ Mount<br></li>\\n<li>Field tripod<br></li>\\n<li>Central control unit with Raspberry Pi<br></li>\\n<li>Counterweight: 6 kg (1 piece)<br></li>\\n<li>Basic hand box<br></li>\\n<li>Connection cables<br></li>\\n<li>Power supply 230V/12V/3A</li>\\n</ol>\\n \", 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000261-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 3033.76, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Bresser-Nebula-6-EQ-Astrophotography-Mount_4.jpg?v=1722540395', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The mount itself weighs less than 5kg but can carry telescopes up to 15kg without counterweight. With counterweight and the counterweight rod (optional) the mount can then carry telescopes up to 20kg in weight. Several years of development and various patents have gone into this exciting new mount and the results speak for themselves.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>So many functions and easy operation:</strong><br>The AM5 can be operated equatorially or azimuthally. For astrophotography, the equatorial mode is normally used and the mount must be aligned as accurately as possible with the celestial pole. For visual observing or lunar and planetary photography, the altazimuth mode is more than sufficient. The status indicator always shows in which mode the mount is: Red represents equatorial mode and green represents altazimuth mode so its easy to identify at a glance.</p>\\n<p><strong>No more counterweights needed:</strong><br>Normally, German equatorial mounts need counterweights to balance the telescope weight and this is the only way to ensure proper operation. However the AM5 uses robotics technology and it does not require counterweights for telescopes up to 15kg. This makes the AM5 lighter, more compact and easier to operate. Only for heavier telescopes up to a maximum of 20kg, then we recommend using counterweights to keep mount and tripod in balance.</p>\\n<p><strong>Smooth tracking is guaranteed:</strong><br>ZWO checks and measures every AM5 mount before delivery and guarantees a periodic error (\"PE\") of less than +/-20 arc seconds and in addition to this the periodic error occurs very slowly, so that the autoguider has enough time to correct it. Via ASIAIR or another software the PE can also be reduced electronically.</p>\\n<p><strong>Useable anywhere on Earth:</strong><br>As you would expect from a true travel mount, the AM5 can be used anywhere on Earth, from the equator to the poles and the compact design of the mount means it has room in any medium sized luggage case.</p>\\n<p><strong>Polar alignment of the mount for astrophotography:</strong><br>In equatorial mode, the mount needs to be aligned exactly with the celestial north or south pole but small errors are of course corrected by autoguiding. Aligning the mount can also be done quickly and easily with the ASIAIR or other suitable software.</p>\\n<p><strong>No more control cables thanks to WiFi:</strong><br>All functions of the mount can also be controlled via smartphone when coupled with the ASIAIR for example. With the ASIAIR, everything from the camera to autoguiding and to the mount itself can be controlled via the ASI app using a smartphone or tablet. The mount can also be separately operated with the hand controller without a smartphone if preferred.</p>\\n<p><strong>Supports cable management to prevent cable entanglement:</strong><br>The saddle plate now integrates DC output and Type-C port to effectively prevent cable entanglement.

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'ZWO AM5N Harmonic Mount + Carbon Fiber Tripod', 'Type': 'Astrophotography Payload > 15kg', 'Body (HTML)': '<p><strong>The ZWO \"Harmonic Equatorial Mount AM5\" is a transportable mount designed specifically for astrophotography. The mount itself weighs less than 5kg but can carry telescopes up to 15kg without counterweight. With counterweight and the counterweight rod (optional) the mount can then carry telescopes up to 20kg in weight. Several years of development and various patents have gone into this exciting new mount and the results speak for themselves.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>So many functions and easy operation:</strong><br>The AM5 can be operated equatorially or azimuthally. For astrophotography, the equatorial mode is normally used and the mount must be aligned as accurately as possible with the celestial pole. For visual observing or lunar and planetary photography, the altazimuth mode is more than sufficient. The status indicator always shows in which mode the mount is: Red represents equatorial mode and green represents altazimuth mode so its easy to identify at a glance.</p>\\n<p><strong>No more counterweights needed:</strong><br>Normally, German equatorial mounts need counterweights to balance the telescope weight and this is the only way to ensure proper operation. However the AM5 uses robotics technology and it does not require counterweights for telescopes up to 15kg. This makes the AM5 lighter, more compact and easier to operate. Only for heavier telescopes up to a maximum of 20kg, then we recommend using counterweights to keep mount and tripod in balance.</p>\\n<p><strong>Smooth tracking is guaranteed:</strong><br>ZWO checks and measures every AM5 mount before delivery and guarantees a periodic error (\"PE\") of less than +/-20 arc seconds and in addition to this the periodic error occurs very slowly, so that the autoguider has enough time to correct it. Via ASIAIR or another software the PE can also be reduced electronically.</p>\\n<p><strong>Useable anywhere on Earth:</strong><br>As you would expect from a true travel mount, the AM5 can be used anywhere on Earth, from the equator to the poles and the compact design of the mount means it has room in any medium sized luggage case.</p>\\n<p><strong>Polar alignment of the mount for astrophotography:</strong><br>In equatorial mode, the mount needs to be aligned exactly with the celestial north or south pole but small errors are of course corrected by autoguiding. Aligning the mount can also be done quickly and easily with the ASIAIR or other suitable software.</p>\\n<p><strong>No more control cables thanks to WiFi:</strong><br>All functions of the mount can also be controlled via smartphone when coupled with the ASIAIR for example. With the ASIAIR, everything from the camera to autoguiding and to the mount itself can be controlled via the ASI app using a smartphone or tablet. The mount can also be separately operated with the hand controller without a smartphone if preferred.</p>\\n<p><strong>Supports cable management to prevent cable entanglement:</strong><br>The saddle plate now integrates DC output and Type-C port to effectively prevent cable entanglement. The unique design ensures that the internal cables will not be twisted and worn when the DEC rotates.</p>\\n<p><span><em>Important notes:</em></span></p>\\n<p><em>There is an ASIAIR finder shoe attached on to the side of the AM5 which is meant for attaching a polar finder scope.

The main sensor is the Sony IMX571 sensor with a native 16-bit ADC, 14 stops dynamic range and 3.76 µm square pixels. The readout noise is as low as 1.0e and the full well capacity reaches an incredible level of 73ke. And on top of all this it has no amp glow!</strong></p>\\n<p>The guide sensor is the type 1/1.8 SC2210 with excellent NIR sensitivity. The sensor size is 7.68mm x 4.32mm. It has 4µm x 4µm pixels with an array of 1920 × 1080 and a full depth of 8780e. The stars on the corner of the guide images affected by reducers back focus distance might not appear very round however this is not due to the sensor tilt and it will not affect normal use.</p>\\n<p><strong>Two-in-one design:</strong><br>Thanks to the compact design, the ASI2600MC Duo only needs one USB cable for control. It reduces potential cabling issues and improves setup speeds. You don´t need a separate OAG and guiding camera.</p>\\n<p><em>The main sensor:</em><br>The main sensor which is the IMX571 features an APS-C format &amp; 26MP total pixels. The size of the sensor is 23.5mm in width x 15.7mm in height, and the diagonal is 28.3mm. The 3.76µm x 3.76µm small pixel size accommodates an impressive full depth of 50ke and with the new hardware technology, it can even be extended to 73ke.</p>\\n<p><em>Guide sensor:</em><br>The SC2210 sensor was taken from the ASI220MM Mini camera and features very high sensitivity. The QE peak value reaches 92% at 500nm and the readout noise is as low as 0.6e. As this is a new generation of guide sensor, it has achieved great results in guiding, proven by hundreds of astrophotographers worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The USB 3.0 cable operates both sensors (Main and Guide sensor). The guide sensor can then be selected in PHD2, for example, and the IMX571 sensor in the imaging software that you are using.</p>\\n<p><strong>Special Features:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>STARVIS technology:</em><br>ASI2600MC DUO is based on Sony\\'s STARVIS technology. Sony\\'s back-illuminated CMOS image sensor improves sensitivity and noise reduction - the key factors to enhancing image quality.</p>\\n<p><em>Native 16bit ADC:</em><br>This 16-bit ADC is not a CCD 16-bit ADC. It can really achieve a dynamic range output of 14 stops, which will significantly improve the image sharpness and contrast, and also create smoother and more natural color transitions.</p>\\n<p><em>FPS:</em><br>ASI2600MC Duo\\'s max FPS in RAW 8 mode at full resolution is 15 fps, which is even quicker compared to ASI2600MC Pro.</p>\\n<p><em>Extended full well mode:</em><br>The full well capacity of ASI2600MC Duo is extended to 73ke, which is x1.46 more than ASI2600MC Pro.</p>\\n<p><em>USB 3.0 &amp; 512 MB DDR3 buffer:</em><br>With the use of the USB 3.0 cable and 512MB DDR3 buffer, ASI2600MC Duo provides a stable and secure data transmission that can effectively avoid frame-dropping issues during long exposures.</p>\\n<p><em>No amp-glow:</em><br>Traditional CMOS sensors produce a weak infrared light source during operation quite often seen in the corner of uncalibrated images. This is the tell-tale sign of amp glow. As the ASI2600MC Duo uses zero-amp glow circuitry so you won´t have to worry about amp glow even when using high gain, long exposure imaging.</p>\\n<p><em>QE (Quantum efficiency):</em><br>Based on ZWO\\'s testing results, the QE peak value of ASI2600MC Duo is over 91%.</p>\\n<p><em>Two-stage TEC cooling:</em><br>Thanks to the two-stage TEC cooling, ASI2600MC Duo can lower the CMOS sensor temperature to more than 35 degrees Celsius below ambient temperature, which can greatly reduce dark current generation and sensor noise even during extended exposure times.</p>\\n<p><em>* The Delta T35 °C is tested at 30°C ambient temperature. It might reduce downwards when the cooling system is working for a long time. Also, as the ambient temperature falls, the Delta T would also decrease.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Dark current noise:</em><br>The dark current noise of the ASI2600MC Duo is extremely low. Even with moderate cooling, you get a very low-noise image.</p>\\n<p><em>Anti-Dew heater:</em><br>There is a polyimide heater completely fitting the protective window in the ASI2600MC Duo camera. It can help avoid any potential annoying dew or icing issues depending on the environment in which you capture images.\\xa0The power of the heater is around 5W. You are free to turn it off anytime in your photography software if you want to save power.</p>\\n<p><strong>Important: external power supply required!</strong><br>This camera requires a 1 amp power supply even during uncooled operation, which can be a problem for USB ports on computers, because they are generally only rated for 900 mA (0.9 A). Stable operation of the camera is therefore only possible with an external 12V power supply.</p>\\n<p><em>Practical Storage advice:\\xa0</em><br>Storage of cameras and accessories, especially in our latitudes, the nights are often very humid. This humidity condenses on your camera, eyepiece or filter when they come into the warm interior of your home after imaging. Cooled cameras are especially affected by this. Good storage is an important prevention mechanism against dew and also extends the life span of your equipment.</p>\\n<p>After use, put the camera immediately into its Protect Case and ideally add some silica gel. During storage, the silica gel will suck the moisture out of the camera. At the same time, the penetration of humid room air is prevented. Dry storage even allows the small dry tablets in cooled cameras to partially regenerate. Your camera or accessories are always ready for you in optimal condition. Silica Gel is available here:</p>\\n<p>The cameras are not airtight, so if the camera remains on the telescope, it is exposed to moisture. The small amount of desiccant in the camera can protect the sensor and the inside of the protective glass from moisture for the duration of the exposure, but not for days on end. Moisture problems can be the result. A simple trick is to stretch a plastic bag around the focuser to which the camera is attached so that no air can get in. Silica gel is placed in a small cloth bag inside the plastic bag. This will also create a \"dry climate zone\" for the camera on the telescope. This allows you to leave the camera on the telescope for a few days for an imaging session lasting several days.</p>\\n<p><strong>Guiding without ST-4 Port:</strong><br>This camera has no ST-4 autoguider port, so you have to connect the mount directly to the PC.</p>\\n<p><strong>Camera Spec:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Sensor: Sony IMX571 (back-illuminated CMOS color sensor)<br></li>\\n<li>Sensor size: 23.5mm x 15.7mm, diagonal 28.3mm<br></li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 3.76µm<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 26 megapixels<br></li>\\n<li>Pixel array: 6248 x 4176 pixels<br></li>\\n<li>Exposure Range: 32µs to 2000s<br></li>\\n<li>Frame rate: up to 15fps</li>\\n<li>ADC: 16 bit<br></li>\\n<li>Cooling: Powerful Peltier cooling - 35°C below ambient<br></li>\\n<li>Full well: 51ke -, up to 73ke - at extended full well mode<br></li>\\n<li>Readout noise: 1.0 to 3.3e<br></li>\\n<li>Sensitivity: Peak 91% QE<br></li>\\n<li>Zero amp glow design: Yes<br></li>\\n<li>Window type: IR cut<br></li>\\n<li>Anti-dew measures: Anti-dew heater, 5 W, can be turned off<br></li>\\n<li>Data interface: USB3.0 (USB2.0 compatible)<br></li>\\n<li>Power consumption: 12V, 3A (5.5/2.1mm, power supply not included)<br></li>\\n<li>Guide sensor type: SC2210<br></li>\\n<li>Dimensions: 7.68mm x 4.32mm<br></li>\\n<li>Pixe size: 4µm x 4µm<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 1920 × 1080 pixels<br></li>\\n<li>QE: 92% at 500nm<br></li>\\n<li>FWC: 8780e<br></li>\\n<li>Readout noise: 0.6e<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope connection: M54 x 0.75 female thread<br></li>\\n<li>Working distance from female thread to sensor: 17.5mm<br></li>\\n<li>Diameter: 90mm<br></li>\\n<li>Length: 97mm<br></li>\\n<li>Weight: 0.8kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Camera<br></li>\\n<li>M54M-M54F adapter (16.5mm)<br></li>\\n<li>M54M-M54F adapter (21mm)<br></li>\\n<li>M54M-M48F adapter<br></li>\\n<li>Hexagon wrench<br></li>\\n<li>USB 3.0 cable (2m) x1<br></li>\\n<li>USB 3.0 cable (0.75m) x1<br></li>\\n<li>USB 2.0 cable (0.5m) x2<br></li>\\n<li>Camera bag<br></li>\\n<li>Quick guide</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Download the ASI 2600MC-P Manual <a>here</a></p>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000267-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 2751.15, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/ZWO-ASI2600MC-DUO_9.jpg?v=1726405981', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The main sensor is the Sony IMX571 sensor with a native 16-bit ADC, 14 stops dynamic range and 3.76 µm square pixels. The readout noise is as low as 1.0e and the full well capacity reaches an incredible level of 73ke. And on top of all this it has no amp glow!</strong></p>\\n<p>The guide sensor is the type 1/1.8 SC2210 with excellent NIR sensitivity. The sensor size is 7.68mm x 4.32mm. It has 4µm x 4µm pixels with an array of 1920 × 1080 and a full depth of 8780e. The stars on the corner of the guide images affected by reducers back focus distance might not appear very round however this is not due to the sensor tilt and it will not affect normal use.</p>\\n<p><strong>Two-in-one design:</strong><br>Thanks to the compact design, the ASI2600MM Duo only needs one USB cable for control. It reduces potential cabling issues and improves setup speeds. You don´t need a separate OAG and guiding camera.</p>\\n<p><em>The main sensor:</em><br>The main sensor which is the IMX571 features an APS-C format &amp; 26MP total pixels. The size of the sensor is 23.5mm in width x 15.7mm in height, and the diagonal is 28.3mm. The 3.76µm x 3.76µm small pixel size accommodates an impressive full depth of 50ke and with the new hardware technology, it can even be extended to 73ke.</p>\\n<p><em>Guide sensor:</em><br>The SC2210 sensor was taken from the ASI220MM Mini camera and features very high sensitivity. The QE peak value reaches 92% at 500nm and the readout noise is as low as 0.6e. As this is a new generation of guide sensor, it has achieved great results in guiding, proven by hundreds of astrophotographers worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The USB 3.0 cable operates both sensors (Main and Guide sensor). The guide sensor can then be selected in PHD2, for example, and the IMX571 sensor in the imaging software that you are using.</p>\\n<p><strong>Special Features:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>STARVIS technology:</em><br>ASI2600MM DUO is based on Sony\\'s STARVIS technology. Sony\\'s back-illuminated CMOS image sensor improves sensitivity and noise reduction - the key factors to enhancing image quality.</p>\\n<p><em>Native 16bit ADC:</em><br>This 16-bit ADC is not a CCD 16-bit ADC. It can really achieve a dynamic range output of 14 stops, which will significantly improve the image sharpness and contrast, and also create smoother and more natural color transitions.</p>\\n<p><em>FPS:</em><br>ASI2600MM Duo\\'s max FPS in RAW 8 mode at full resolution is 15 fps.</p>\\n<p><em>Extended full well mode:</em><br>The full well capacity of ASI2600MM Duo is extended to 73ke.</p>\\n<p><em>USB 3.0 &amp; 512 MB DDR3 buffer:</em><br>With the use of the USB 3.0 cable and 512MB DDR3 buffer, ASI2600MM Duo provides a stable and secure data transmission that can effectively avoid frame-dropping issues during long exposures.</p>\\n<p><em>No amp-glow:</em><br>Traditional CMOS sensors produce a weak infrared light source during operation quite often seen in the corner of uncalibrated images. This is the tell-tale sign of amp glow. As the ASI2600MM Duo uses zero-amp glow circuitry so you won´t have to worry about amp glow even when using high gain, long exposure imaging.</p>\\n<p><em>QE (Quantum efficiency):</em><br>Based on ZWO\\'s testing results, the QE peak value of ASI2600MM Duo is over 91%.</p>\\n<p><em>Two-stage TEC cooling:</em><br>Thanks to the two-stage TEC cooling, ASI2600MM Duo can lower the CMOS sensor temperature to more than 35 degrees Celsius below ambient temperature, which can greatly reduce dark current generation and sensor noise even during extended exposure times.</p>\\n<p><em>* The Delta T35 °C is tested at 30°C ambient temperature. It might reduce downwards when the cooling system is working for a long time. Also, as the ambient temperature falls, the Delta T would also decrease.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Dark current noise:</em><br>The dark current noise of the ASI2600MM Duo is extremely low. Even with moderate cooling, you get a very low-noise image.</p>\\n<p><em>Anti-Dew heater:</em><br>There is a polyimide heater completely fitting the protective window in the ASI2600MM Duo camera. It can help avoid any potential annoying dew or icing issues depending on the environment in which you capture images.\\xa0The power of the heater is around 5W. You are free to turn it off anytime in your photography software if you want to save power.</p>\\n<p><strong>Important: external power supply required!</strong><br>This camera requires a 1 amp power supply even during uncooled operation, which can be a problem for USB ports on computers, because they are generally only rated for 900 mA (0.9 A). Stable operation of the camera is therefore only possible with an external 12V power supply.</p>\\n<p><em>Practical Storage advice:\\xa0</em><br>Storage of cameras and accessories, especially in our latitudes, the nights are often very humid. This humidity condenses on your camera, eyepiece or filter when they come into the warm interior of your home after imaging. Cooled cameras are especially affected by this. Good storage is an important prevention mechanism against dew and also extends the life span of your equipment.</p>\\n<p>After use, put the camera immediately into its Protect Case and ideally add some silica gel. During storage, the silica gel will suck the moisture out of the camera. At the same time, the penetration of humid room air is prevented. Dry storage even allows the small dry tablets in cooled cameras to partially regenerate. Your camera or accessories are always ready for you in optimal condition. Silica Gel is available here:</p>\\n<p>The cameras are not airtight, so if the camera remains on the telescope, it is exposed to moisture. The small amount of desiccant in the camera can protect the sensor and the inside of the protective glass from moisture for the duration of the exposure, but not for days on end. Moisture problems can be the result. A simple trick is to stretch a plastic bag around the focuser to which the camera is attached so that no air can get in. Silica gel is placed in a small cloth bag inside the plastic bag. This will also create a \"dry climate zone\" for the camera on the telescope. This allows you to leave the camera on the telescope for a few days for an imaging session lasting several days.</p>\\n<p><strong>Guiding without ST-4 Port:</strong><br>This camera has no ST-4 autoguider port, so you have to connect the mount directly to the PC.</p>\\n<p><strong>Camera Spec:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Sensor: Sony IMX571 (back-illuminated CMOS mono sensor)<br></li>\\n<li>Sensor size: 23.5mm x 15.7mm, diagonal 28.3mm<br></li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 3.76µm<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 26 megapixels<br></li>\\n<li>Pixel array: 6248 x 4176 pixels<br></li>\\n<li>Exposure Range: 32µs to 2000s<br></li>\\n<li>Frame rate: up to 15fps</li>\\n<li>ADC: 16 bit<br></li>\\n<li>Cooling: Powerful Peltier cooling - 35°C below ambient<br></li>\\n<li>Full well: 51ke -, up to 73ke - at extended full well mode<br></li>\\n<li>Readout noise: 1.0 to 3.3e<br></li>\\n<li>Sensitivity: Peak 91% QE<br></li>\\n<li>Zero amp glow design: Yes<br></li>\\n<li>Window type: IR Window<br></li>\\n<li>Anti-dew measures: Anti-dew heater, 5W, can be turned off<br></li>\\n<li>Data interface: USB3.0 (USB2.0 compatible)<br></li>\\n<li>Power consumption: 12V, 3A (5.5/2.1mm, power supply not included)<br></li>\\n<li>Guide sensor type: SC2210<br></li>\\n<li>Dimensions: 7.68mm x 4.32mm<br></li>\\n<li>Pixe size: 4µm x 4µm<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 1920 × 1080 pixels<br></li>\\n<li>QE: 92% at 500nm<br></li>\\n<li>FWC: 8780e<br></li>\\n<li>Readout noise: 0.6 e<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope connection: M54 x 0.75 female thread<br></li>\\n<li>Working distance from female thread to sensor: 17.5mm<br></li>\\n<li>Diameter: 90mm<br></li>\\n<li>Length: 97mm<br></li>\\n<li>Weight: 0.8kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Camera<br></li>\\n<li>M54M-M54F adapter (16.5mm)<br></li>\\n<li>M54M-M54F adapter (21mm)<br></li>\\n<li>M54M-M48F adapter<br></li>\\n<li>Hexagon wrench<br></li>\\n<li>USB 3.0 cable (2m) x1<br></li>\\n<li>USB 3.0 cable (0.75m) x1<br></li>\\n<li>USB 2.0 cable (0.5m) x2<br></li>\\n<li>Camera bag<br></li>\\n<li>Quick guide</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Download the ASI 2600MC-P Manual <a>here</a></p>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000268-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 3427.79, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/ZWO-ASI2600MC-DUO_9_17a37e03-5437-49de-ba3f-d73bd143b84f.jpg?v=1726407744', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The modern Sony IMX585 sensor is particularly impressive due to its high resolution (2.9 µm pixels), high frame rate and the complete absence of any amp glow. This makes this camera very interesting not only for planets, the sun and the moon, but also for long exposures (deep-sky photography). The sensor is large enough for many deep-sky objects, yet you can usually manage without a corrector. The ASI585MP Pro is an ideal entry-level camera but also an exciting second camera for dedicated astrophotographers.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><em>The camera is very well suited for:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Lunar and planetary photography with high detail resolution<br></li>\\n<li>Solar photography (with suitable filter) with high detail resolution<br></li>\\n<li>Long exposures of nebulae and galaxies<br></li>\\n<li>Infrared photography to reduce the effects of seeing, resulting in a sharper luminance channel<br></li>\\n<li>EAA (electronically assisted astronomy) for planets, moon and sun.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This camera is a great alternative to a DSLR and mirrorless camera for deep-sky photography. Even the raw images are of high quality, as the sensor no longer shows any amplifier glow and the images are very smooth and low in noise. Added to this is the powerful Peltier cooling up to 35°C below ambient temperature, which means that low-noise images can be taken even at the height of summer.</p>\\n<p><em>Moon and planetary photography:</em><br>Thanks to the fine 2.9µm pixels, you can achieve a very high resolution from f/10, which makes the use of Barlow and converter systems superfluous.</p>\\n<p><em>EAA (electronically assisted astronomy):</em><br>The high resolution, combined with a high frame rate of 47 fps at full resolution (RAW8 format), allows real-time observation not only of planets, but also of the moon and sun due to the relatively large sensor. This means you can observe together in a group - without having to wait until everyone has had a turn!</p>\\n<p><em>Anti-reflective clear glass filter protects the sensor from dust:</em><br>The clear glass filter prevents dust from penetrating the sensor. It also lets UV and infrared light through so that you can also use the camera for infrared photography. With the right choice of contrast filters, fog filters, IR pass filters or UV/IR blocking filters, you have full control over which light falls on the sensor.</p>\\n<p><em>Peltier cooling - reduces the sensor temperature:</em><br>The sensor heats up during shooting. Thanks to the controlled Peltier cooling, you can keep the sensor well cooled even at high outside temperatures. At an ambient temperature of 20°C you can cool the sensor down to -15 °C.</p>\\n<p><em>Very high sensitivity for short exposure times:</em><br>One advantage of the back-illuminated CMOS sensor is the reduced readout noise and improved sensitivity. In particular, Sony uses STARVIS-2 technology with the IMX585 sensor, which ensures excellent visibility in low light. You can achieve a very high light yield in astrophotography and obtain high image quality not only in visible light but also in the near infrared range (to reduce seeing). In addition, the low readout noise and the high full-well capacity ensure a larger dynamic range.</p>\\n<p>In combination with the large field of view offered by the large sensor format, the ASI585MC is not only ideal for solar, lunar and planetary imaging, but can also be used as a live streaming camera or as an all-sky camera for observing or monitoring weather conditions.</p>\\n<p>The low noise and anti-amp glow circuit make this Peltier-cooled camera interesting for capturing deep-sky objects such as faint nebulae, star clusters and galaxies.</p>\\n<p><em>The HCG mode:</em><br>The camera has a built-in HCG mode that can effectively reduce readout noise at high gain while maintaining the same wide dynamic range you would expect at low gain. When the gain is 252, the HCG mode turns on automatically. As a result, the readout noise is only 0.7e-, while the dynamic range can still reach almost 12 f-stops.</p>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Sensor: Sony 1/1.2 inch CMOS IMX585AAQJ1-C (color)<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 3840 x 2160 pixels, 8.28 megapixels<br></li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 2.9 µm<br></li>\\n<li>Sensor size: 11.13mm x 6.26mm<br></li>\\n<li>Sensor diagonal: m12.84mm<br></li>\\n<li>Exposure time:m from 32 µs - 2000 s<br></li>\\n<li>Recording speed: up to 46.9 fps at 4K UHD resolution<br></li>\\n<li>ROI: Supported<br></li>\\n<li>Quantum efficiency: 91 %<br></li>\\n<li>ADC: 12 bit<br></li>\\n<li>Full well: 40 ke-<br></li>\\n<li>Antiampglow circuit: Yes<br></li>\\n<li>Readout noise: 0.7 e-<br></li>\\n<li>Distance from T2 female thread to sensor: 17.5mm<br></li>\\n<li>Distance from T2 male thread: 6.5mm (the male thread does not count)<br></li>\\n<li>Shutter type: Rolling shutter<br></li>\\n<li>Protection window: AR dust protection window (UV and IR light are transmitted)<br></li>\\n<li>Connection: USB3.0/USB2.0<br></li>\\n<li>Bit resolution: \\xa0 \\xa012 bit output (12 bit ADC)<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope connection: 2\" / 1.25\" / M42x0.75<br></li>\\n<li>Size: 78mm diameter and 86mm length<br></li>\\n<li>Weight: 410 grams</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>ASI camera cooled, with 11mm T2 ring</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Camera bag</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>USB3.0 cable, 2m</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Quick guide (English)</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>T2 extension (21mm long)</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>M48 to T2 adapter (16.5mm long)</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Adapter from T2 to 1.25\" receptacle with filter thread</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Cover cap 1.25\"</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>M42-M48 adapter (without optical path)</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>2x USB 2.0 cable, 0.5m</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Flat adapter T2 to 1.25\" thread (without optical path)</em><br></li>\\n<li><em>4x spacer ring</em></li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000271-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 809.34, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/ZWO-ASI-585MC-PRO_01c770ee-4ba8-4712-a6e0-21e4f71ef165.jpg?v=1727254252', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

With the StarSense Explorer, finding objects has never been easier, faster, and more accurate. Within minutes of setting up the telescope, you can begin moving confidently in the sky.</p>\\n<p>Simply place your phone in the unique StarSense Dock and launch the StarSense Explorer app. After aiming your phone at the telescope\\'s optics (which can be done in two minutes), the StarSense Explorer generates a list of currently visible celestial objects. Make your selection, and arrows appear on the screen to help you move the telescope. When the object is visible in the eyepiece, the crosshairs turn green.</p>\\n<p><em>Smartphone compatibility:</em><br>StarSense Explorer works with most current smartphones, including iPhone 6 and newer and most devices running Android 7.1.2 or higher manufactured since 2016.

The StarSense Explorer is ideal for beginners thanks to its user-friendly interface and detailed tutorials. It\\'s like having your own personal guide to the night sky.</strong></p>\\n<p>Dock, launch, explore:<br>Leave complicated star charts, imprecise planetarium programs, and computerized mounts behind. With the StarSense Explorer, finding objects has never been easier, faster, and more accurate. Within minutes of setting up the telescope, you can begin moving confidently in the sky.</p>\\n<p>Simply place your phone in the unique StarSense Dock and launch the StarSense Explorer app. After aiming your phone at the telescope\\'s optics (which can be done in two minutes), the StarSense Explorer generates a list of currently visible celestial objects. Make your selection, and arrows appear on the screen to help you move the telescope. When the object is visible in the eyepiece, the crosshairs turn green.</p>\\n<p>Smartphone compatibility:<br>StarSense Explorer works with most current smartphones, including iPhone 6 and newer and most devices running Android 7.1.2 or higher manufactured since 2016. For a full compatibility list, click here .</p>\\n<p>Patent pending StarSense Sky technology:<br>StarSense Explorer uses patent-pending technology and your smartphone to determine exactly where the telescope is pointed in the night sky. A Lost-in-Space Algorithm (LISA), the same algorithm used by orbiting satellites to correctly reorient themselves, helps the app match the star patterns it detects with its internal database.</p>\\n<p>While other astronomy apps claim to help you find objects, they rely solely on the phone\\'s compass, gyroscopes, and accelerometers, which are not as accurate as LISA\\'s technology. No other app can tell you exactly when your target will be visible in the eyepiece.</p>\\n<p><em>Robust azimuthal mount:</em><br>The StarSense Explorer LT\\'s intuitive alt-azimuth mount makes it easy to point the telescope at the target. A fine adjustment knob for the altitude axis helps you fine-tune the telescope to the object and track targets as the Earth rotates beneath the night sky. Everything is mounted on a large, height-adjustable tripod.</p>\\n<p><em>Perfect views with high-quality optics:</em><br>With its large 102mm (4\") objective lens, this telescope has enough light gathering power to see impressive details in celestial objects. You can expect sharp, bright views of Jupiter\\'s four Galilean moons, its cloud bands, and its Great Red Spot, as well as the rings of Saturn and the Trapezium stars in the Orion Nebula. Don\\'t miss the beautiful Pleiades open star cluster! Celestron\\'s XLT coating improves light transmission, making details in celestial objects more clearly visible.</p>\\n<p><em>Perfect for the city as well as dark locations:</em><br>Even if you live in a place with slightly bright skies and moderate light pollution, the StarSense Explorer is powerful enough to locate Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, the Orion Nebula, binary stars, and some of the most famous celestial objects.</p>\\n<p>However, if you can move the telescope to a slightly darker location, even more objects will become visible. With this 4-inch refractor and relatively dark skies, the Andromeda Galaxy, the globular cluster M13 in Hercules, and many others are easily visible.</p>\\n<p>The entire telescope weighs only 6.4kg, making it perfectly portable and easy to take with you on your next camping trip or to a remote observing site.</p>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optical Design: Refractor<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution (DAWES): 1.14 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution (RAYLEIGH): 1.37 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Focal length: 660mm (25.98\")<br></li>\\n<li>Limit size: 12.5<br></li>\\n<li>Highest useful magnification: x240<br></li>\\n<li>Light gathering capacity (compared to the human eye): x212<br></li>\\n<li>Lowest useful magnification: x15<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope aperture: 102mmmm (4.01\")<br></li>\\n<li>Tube (material): Aluminium<br></li>\\n<li>Tube weight: 2.66kg<br></li>\\n<li>Tube size (max): 118mm (4.64\")<br></li>\\n<li>Tube length: 609.6cm (24\")<br></li>\\n<li>Fully coated XLT glass optics<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture ratio: f/6.5</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Mount Spec:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Alignment Methods: StarSense Explorer App<br></li>\\n<li>Mount type: Azimuthal mount (manual)<br></li>\\n<li>Mount control: Manual<br></li>\\n<li>Dovetail: CG-5 dovetail rail<br></li>\\n<li>Dovetail compatible: CG-5 dovetail rail<br></li>\\n<li>Panning speed: Manually<br></li>\\n<li>Features: StarSense Explorer App, SkyPortal App, Celestron Starry Night Basic Edition Software</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Focal length eyepieces: 25mm, 10mm</em><br><em>Incl. accessories: Telescope tube, Mount/Tripod (pre-assembled) , Amici prism for an upright and laterally correct image, StarPointer finder scope, Accessory tray, StarSense Explorer Smartphone Dock.</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Viewfinder: StarPointer™ Finderscope</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Zenith prism: Straightens the image by 90° and displays it correctly (1.25\")</em><br></li>\\n<li><em>Accessory tray: Yes</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000273-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 566.23, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Celestron-Starsense-Explorer-DX102_11.webp?v=1727283760', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The StarSense Explorer is ideal for beginners thanks to its user-friendly interface and detailed tutorials. It\\'s like having your own personal guide to the night sky.</strong></p>\\n<p><em>High quality azimuthal mount:</em><br>The Rockerbox, developed by Celestron, is an ultra-stable, aesthetically pleasing mount with Teflon azimuth bearings. Large 15cm diameter altitude bearings ensure smooth up and down movement. The altitude bearings have a \"braking system\" that allows the resistance to be adjusted to allow smooth movement even with slight imbalances. Bracing for the side panels provides additional stability and rigidity - a feature normally only seen on larger Dobsonians.</p>\\n<p>With the handle at the front of the tube you can move the telescope easily and sensitively.</p>\\n<p><em>High-quality optics for the perfect view into space:</em><br>With the large 8\" primary mirror, this Dobson has enough light gathering power to see impressive details in celestial objects. The highly reflective coating on both the primary and secondary mirrors provides sharp, bright images.</p>\\n<p>The primary and secondary mirrors are coated with StarBright XLT coating to increase contrast and light transmission. StarBright XLT reveals subtle details whether you are looking at the moon and planets or faint galaxies and nebulae. For more information on the patented StarBright XLT coatings, click \\xa0here .</p>\\n<p>This telescope is also equipped with a high-quality 2\" Crayford focuser . The Crayford system enables precise and smooth focusing without focus drift. The scope of delivery also includes a 2\" to 1.25\" reducer and a 2\" extension sleeve, so you can use virtually any 1.25\" or 2\" eyepiece on your StarSense Explorer Dobson. The focuser also has a locking screw that allows you to lock it in the sharpest position.</p>\\n<p><em>Ideal for every location:</em><br>Even if you live in a location with slightly bright skies and moderate light pollution, StarSense Explorer can locate Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, the Orion Nebula, binary stars, and many more of the most famous celestial objects.</p>\\n<p>From a darker location, you can see these objects better, and observe many other targets. From an aperture of 8\" deep sky observation is really fun, as many globular clusters can be clearly resolved into individual stars, and the first galaxies show details such as spiral arms. At the observation location, all you have to do is put the telescope in the mount, insert the eyepiece and smartphone, and start the app, and you can start observing! The eyepiece holder ensures that you always have all eyepieces within reach when observing.</p>\\n<p>The entire telescope weighs only 19.6kg, making it perfectly portable and easy to take with you on your next camping trip or to a remote observing site.</p>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optical Design: Newtonian Reflector<br></li>\\n<li>Focal length: 1200mm<br></li>\\n<li>Recommended telescope aperture: 203mm (8\")<br></li>\\n<li>Substrates: Pyrex equivalent for primary and secondary mirrors<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope series: StarSense Explorer<br></li>\\n<li>Tube (material): Steel<br></li>\\n<li>Tube weight: 9.3kg<br></li>\\n<li>Tube size (max): 44\" x 9.5\" (112 x 24cm)</li>\\n<li>Remuneration: StarBright XLT<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture ratio: f/5.9</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Mount Specs:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Alignment Methods: StarSense Explorer App<br></li>\\n<li>Mount: Dobson<br></li>\\n<li>Mount control: Manually<br></li>\\n<li>Panning speed: Manually<br></li>\\n<li>Features: StarSense Explorer App<br></li>\\n<li>Type: Azimuthal Dobson mount (69cm x 48cm x 48cm)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Focal length eyepiece: 25mm</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Incl. accessories: </em><em>Optical Tube, Mount (pre-assembled), StarPointer red dot finder, Eyepiece tray, </em><em>StarSense Explorer smartphone dock, Collimation mask, dust cover</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Viewfinder: StarPointer™ Red Dot Finder</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Accessory tray: Yes (eyepiece storage)</em><br></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000274-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 1194.26, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Celestron-Starsense-8-Dobsonian_18.webp?v=1727283458', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'Celestron NexStar - 6SE', 'Type': '6\" Schmidt Cassegrain', 'Body (HTML)': '<p><strong>Each Celestron Nexstar SE telescope is exceptionally easy to use and offers all the conveniences of a modern, computerized telescope that can automatically locate over 38,000 objects and even suggests which celestial objects are best observed from your location at the moment. They are also suitable for even getting started in astrophotography.</strong></p>\\n<p>Thanks to the powerful SkyAlign technology, setting up the telescope correctly to find even the most difficult galaxies is no longer a problem. Simply point the telescope at three stars and it will be ready for use in no time. This gives you an exceptionally affordable telescope with a range of features that previous generations of amateur astronomers could only have dreamed of (Note: you only need to see the three \"guide stars\", you don\\'t need to know them).</p>\\n<p>You can even remotely control this telescope with your iPhone, iPad or Windows PC via WiFi using the optional SkyQ-Link WiFi adapter and the SkyQ app, which is available separately from the Apple AppStore - simply use the star map on the screen. So if you are looking for a telescope with the most modern control electronics, then choose the Celestron NexStar SE. With the optional StarSense module, the telescope even takes over the initialization in the starry sky itself - all you have to do is set up the telescope, switch it on and wait three minutes.</p>\\n<p><em>The NexStar 6SE - the lightweight all-rounder for deep sky and planets:</em><br>The NexStar 6SE is the middle of the range Schmidt-Cassegrain in the NexStar SE series with a 6\" aperture. It is the ideal compromise between portability and performance - with this aperture, globular clusters are partially resolved, for example, and galaxies and nebulae are easy to see under dark skies. Near cities, nebula filters help to block out the scattered light from cities.</p>\\n<p>The telescope has the 1.25\" focuser connection that is common in astronomy. This means that all common astronomical 1.25\" eyepieces (plug size: 31.7mm) can be used which covers all useful magnifications and enables quick switching between different magnifications. Adapters are also available to use 2\" eyepieces and accessories.</p>\\n<p>SLR cameras and numerous other accessories can also be connected using a separately available T-adapter. The T-thread is a standard item that can be used to connect almost any accessory - from SLR cameras to binocular attachments.</p>\\n<p><em>The NexStar 6/8SE mount:</em><br>The mount of the 6SE and 8SE telescopes are larger and more stable than the mount of the smaller models. This azimuthal single-arm mount is optimized to be ready for use quickly and easy to transport. Unlike the classic parallactic mount, you do not have to spend time aligning the telescope to the north, setting the polar height or taking counterweights with you. The mount is simply set up horizontally and after alignment (in which you simply set any three bright stars), the computer automatically ensures that the telescope moves to the desired objects and keeps them in the eyepiece: the automatic tracking automatically compensates for the rotation of the earth.</p>\\n<p>This makes the SE telescopes ideal for anyone who wants to observe the starry sky themselves: very portable, quickly ready for use and with all the necessary comfort.</p>\\n<p>The telescope is attached to the mount with a standard prism rail with quick coupling, so it can be easily removed. The mount can also provide stable support for other telescopes up to approx. 5.5kg. However, this is not necessary for transport: the complete mount including telescope is very handy and fits, for example, in the separately available, padded transport case. It is simply attached to the stable steel tripod with three easy-to-grip screws; a centering pin helps when placing it on the tripod.</p>\\n<p>The NexStar 6/8SE mount also offers everything you need for photography: lunar photography with an SLR camera or planetary photography with a video camera are also possible without any problems in azimuthal operation with the correct camera adapter. Long exposures are also possible using the optional Heavy Duty Deluxe polar wedge: The mount is aligned parallel to the earth\\'s axis, like a classic parallactic (\"astronomical\") mount.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>A software installed in the hand controller helps you to easily align the mount with high precision even without a polar finder. This not only prevents the image field from rotating when you photograph for example a lunar eclipse over a long period of time but also allows deep sky imaging. An AUX connection enables the connection of additional accessories - from GPS receivers to StarSense modules.</p>\\n<p><em>Comprehensive star catalogs and TOUR function for an overview:</em><br>The hand controller contains a database with over 38,000 objects. These include, of course, the planets of the solar system as well as countless galaxies, gas nebulae, star clusters and interesting stars. Are you having trouble choosing? Then use the TOUR mode, which shows you a selection of the most beautiful objects every evening and explains them on the display.</p>\\n<p><em>SkyAlign - Setup without knowledge of the sky:</em><br>The NexStar SE mount has motors with encoders on both axes and a hand controller with 38,181 objects in the database. To initialize the computer control, all you have to do is enter the time and location (selectable from the database) into the hand controller and move to any three bright celestial objects - it doesn\\'t matter which ones, you don\\'t even have to know them! After this SkyAlign, the mount knows what the sky above it looks like and controls each additional object at the touch of a button.</p>\\n<p>With the optional Celestron SkySync GPS module, you save yourself the trouble of entering the date, time and observation location, making setup even easier. This data is automatically transferred to the telescope via the GPS satellites.</p>\\n<p>The SE telescopes are also compatible with the StarSense module. Behind this is a small camera that is mounted on the telescope and uses to orient the telescope fully automatically in the sky - without GPS. With StarSense, all you have to do is set up the telescope, switch it on and wait about three minutes. Since StarSense is compatible with all modern, computer-controlled Celestron telescopes, you can continue to use it even if you ever buy a larger telescope - StarSense also works with observatory-class telescopes.</p>\\n<p>This means that a NexStar SE telescope can be updated at any time when there are technical innovations - this ensures that your telescope retains its value!</p>\\n<p><em>Control via PC and iPhone:</em><br>Like all Celestron NexStar telescopes, the NexStar SE can also be controlled via PC. All you need is the optional Celestron RS cable and, if necessary, an adapter from RS232 to USB. You can then control the telescope from a Windows PC using the NexRemote software or the widely used ASCOM interface.</p>\\n<p>But the SE telescopes also support wireless control! You can control the telescope wirelessly using the optional SkyQ Link WLAN adapter - either via a Windows PC or via iPhone or iPad (with the optional SkyQ planetarium program). This means you don\\'t have to take a laptop with you on your observation nights, an iPhone is enough, and you have a modern graphic telescope control in addition to the hand controller.</p>\\n<p><strong>Well thought-out mount:</strong><br>The mount of the Celestron NexStar SE telescopes is a solid azimuthal single-arm mount that can be set up without tools. The large, easy-to-grip screws mean that this can also be done with gloves. The sturdy steel tripod has a shelf for accessories and a holder for the hand control box. The SE mount can carry devices weighing up to approx. 5.5kg, depending on the design. The clamping device on the arm of the mount fits any standardized Vixen (V) dovetail and holds it securely.</p>\\n<p>The hand controller is neatly integrated into the fork arm and can be removed if necessary. The telescope can also be operated comfortably when it is in the fork arm holder.</p>\\n<p><strong>Power supply:</strong><br>The computer control is of course dependent on electricity. The mount offers several options for power supply: Either via eight standard AA batteries if you want to be completely independent, or via an optional connection cable for the cigarette lighter socket of a car or via an optional power supply unit. The battery compartment integrated into the mount avoids cable clutter and enables maximum mobility.</p>\\n<p><strong>* Important: Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong></p>\\n<p>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case.</p>\\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optical design: Schmidt-Cassegrain<br></li>\\n<li>Optical coating: Starbright XLT (Fully multi-coated)<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution (DAWES): 0.77 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution (RAYLEIGH): 0.93 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Focal length: 1500mm<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction: 5.6cm<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction relative to diameter: 37.00%<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction relative to surface: 14.00%<br></li>\\n<li>Visual field: 0.83 °<br></li>\\n<li>Limit size: 13.4<br></li>\\n<li>Highest useful magnification: x354<br></li>\\n<li>Light gathering capacity (compared to the human eye): x459<br></li>\\n<li>Linear Field of View (@1000 yds): 44 ft (13 m)<br></li>\\n<li>Lowest useful magnification: x21<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope aperture: 150mm (5.91\")<br></li>\\n<li>Focuser size (inches): 1.25“<br></li>\\n<li>Tube length: 41cm<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture ratio: f/10</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Mount Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Connections: USB on the hand controller, Aux port<br></li>\\n<li>Multi-language: Yes</li>\\n<li>GPS: with optional SkySync module<br></li>\\n<li>Hand controller: NexStar+ hand controller, two-line LCD display with 16 characters, 19 backlit keys, USB 2.0 port for PC connection<br></li>\\n<li>Power requirements: 8-AA batteries (not included), optional power supply<br></li>\\n<li>Alignment Methods: SkyAlign, Auto 2-Star Align, 1-Star Align, 2-Star Align, Solar System Align<br></li>\\n<li>Database: Over 38,000+ properties, 100 custom listings, More information on over 200 properties<br></li>\\n<li>Mount: Azimuthal mount (motorized)<br></li>\\n<li>Mount control: Computer controlled (GOTO)<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking speeds: Sidereal, solar and lunar<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking modes: Azimuthal, EQ-North, EQ-South<br></li>\\n<li>Dovetail compatible: EQ Standard (Vixen Style)<br></li>\\n<li>Panning speed: Nine speeds<br></li>\\n<li>Mount Type: Alt-Azimuth single-arm mount</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Focal length eyepiece: 25mm</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Incl. accessories: 6\" Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, pre-assembled steel tripod, accessory tray, computer-controlled Nexstar 6/8SE mount with NexStar hand controller, StarPointer red dot finder, 25mm eyepiece, 1.25\" star diagonal prism, cigarette lighter cable</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Viewfinder: StarPointer</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Zenith prism: 1.25\"</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li><em>Accessory tray: with eyepiece tray</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000275-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 1650.08, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Celestron-Nexstar-6SE_2.webp?v=1727284439', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'Celestron NexStar - 8SE', 'Type': '8\" Schmidt Cassegrain', 'Body (HTML)': '<p><strong>Each Celestron Nexstar SE telescope is exceptionally easy to use and offers all the conveniences of a modern, computerized telescope that can automatically locate over 38,000 objects and even suggests which celestial objects are best observed from your location at the moment. They are also suitable for even getting started in astrophotography.</strong></p>\\n<p>Thanks to the powerful SkyAlign technology, setting up the telescope correctly to find even the most difficult galaxies is no longer a problem. Simply point the telescope at three stars and it will be ready for use in no time. This gives you an exceptionally affordable telescope with a range of features that previous generations of amateur astronomers could only have dreamed of (Note: you only need to see the three \"guide stars\", you don\\'t need to know them).</p>\\n<p>You can even remotely control this telescope with your iPhone, iPad or Windows PC via WiFi using the optional SkyQ-Link WiFi adapter and the SkyQ app, which is available separately from the Apple AppStore - simply use the star map on the screen. So if you are looking for a telescope with the most modern control electronics, then choose the Celestron NexStar SE. With the optional StarSense module, the telescope even takes over the initialization in the starry sky itself - all you have to do is set up the telescope, switch it on and wait three minutes.</p>\\n<p><em>The NexStar 8SE - the lightweight all-rounder for deep sky and planets:</em><br>The NexStar 8SE is the middle to higher range Schmidt-Cassegrain in the NexStar SE series with an 8\" aperture. It is the ideal compromise between portability and performance - with this aperture, globular clusters are very well resolved and brighter galaxies and nebulae start to show more detail under dark skies. Near cities, nebula filters can be used to help block out the scattered light from cities.</p>\\n<p>The telescope has the 1.25\" focuser connection that is common in astronomy. This means that all common astronomical 1.25\" eyepieces (plug size: 31.7mm) can be used which covers all useful magnifications and enables quick switching between different magnifications. Adapters are also available to use 2\" eyepieces and accessories.</p>\\n<p>SLR cameras and numerous other accessories can also be connected using a separately available T-adapter. The T-thread is a standard item that can be used to connect almost any accessory - from SLR cameras to binocular attachments.</p>\\n<p><em>The NexStar 6/8SE mount:</em><br>The mount of the 6SE and 8SE telescopes are larger and more stable than the mount of the smaller models. This azimuthal single-arm mount is optimized to be ready for use quickly and easy to transport. Unlike the classic parallactic mount, you do not have to spend time aligning the telescope to the north, setting the polar height or taking counterweights with you. The mount is simply set up horizontally and after alignment (in which you simply set any three bright stars), the computer automatically ensures that the telescope moves to the desired objects and keeps them in the eyepiece: the automatic tracking automatically compensates for the rotation of the earth.</p>\\n<p>This makes the SE telescopes ideal for anyone who wants to observe the starry sky themselves: very portable, quickly ready for use and with all the necessary comfort.</p>\\n<p>The telescope is attached to the mount with a standard prism rail with quick coupling, so it can be easily removed. The mount can also provide stable support for other telescopes up to approx. 5.5kg. However, this is not necessary for transport: the complete mount including telescope is very handy and fits, for example, in the separately available, padded transport case. It is simply attached to the stable steel tripod with three easy-to-grip screws; a centering pin helps when placing it on the tripod.</p>\\n<p>The NexStar 6/8SE mount also offers everything you need for photography: lunar photography with an SLR camera or planetary photography with a video camera are also possible without any problems in azimuthal operation with the correct camera adapter. Long exposures are also possible using the optional Heavy Duty Deluxe polar wedge: The mount is aligned parallel to the earth\\'s axis, like a classic parallactic (\"astronomical\") mount.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>A software installed in the hand controller helps you to easily align the mount with high precision even without a polar finder. This not only prevents the image field from rotating when you photograph for example a lunar eclipse over a long period of time but also allows deep sky imaging. An AUX connection enables the connection of additional accessories - from GPS receivers to StarSense modules.</p>\\n<p><em>Comprehensive star catalogs and TOUR function for an overview:</em><br>The hand controller contains a database with over 38,000 objects. These include, of course, the planets of the solar system as well as countless galaxies, gas nebulae, star clusters and interesting stars. Are you having trouble choosing? Then use the TOUR mode, which shows you a selection of the most beautiful objects every evening and explains them on the display.</p>\\n<p><em>SkyAlign - Setup without knowledge of the sky:</em><br>The NexStar SE mount has motors with encoders on both axes and a hand controller with 38,181 objects in the database. To initialize the computer control, all you have to do is enter the time and location (selectable from the database) into the hand controller and move to any three bright celestial objects - it doesn\\'t matter which ones, you don\\'t even have to know them! After this SkyAlign, the mount knows what the sky above it looks like and controls each additional object at the touch of a button.</p>\\n<p>With the optional Celestron SkySync GPS module, you save yourself the trouble of entering the date, time and observation location, making setup even easier. This data is automatically transferred to the telescope via the GPS satellites.</p>\\n<p>The SE telescopes are also compatible with the StarSense module. Behind this is a small camera that is mounted on the telescope and uses to orient the telescope fully automatically in the sky - without GPS. With StarSense, all you have to do is set up the telescope, switch it on and wait about three minutes. Since StarSense is compatible with all modern, computer-controlled Celestron telescopes, you can continue to use it even if you ever buy a larger telescope - StarSense also works with observatory-class telescopes.</p>\\n<p>This means that a NexStar SE telescope can be updated at any time when there are technical innovations - this ensures that your telescope retains its value!</p>\\n<p><em>Control via PC and iPhone:</em><br>Like all Celestron NexStar telescopes, the NexStar SE can also be controlled via PC. All you need is the optional Celestron RS cable and, if necessary, an adapter from RS232 to USB. You can then control the telescope from a Windows PC using the NexRemote software or the widely used ASCOM interface.</p>\\n<p>But the SE telescopes also support wireless control! You can control the telescope wirelessly using the optional SkyQ Link WLAN adapter - either via a Windows PC or via iPhone or iPad (with the optional SkyQ planetarium program). This means you don\\'t have to take a laptop with you on your observation nights, an iPhone is enough, and you have a modern graphic telescope control in addition to the hand controller.</p>\\n<p><strong>Well thought-out mount:</strong><br>The mount of the Celestron NexStar SE telescopes is a solid azimuthal single-arm mount that can be set up without tools. The large, easy-to-grip screws mean that this can also be done with gloves. The sturdy steel tripod has a shelf for accessories and a holder for the hand control box. The SE mount can carry devices weighing up to approx. 5.5kg, depending on the design. The clamping device on the arm of the mount fits any standardized Vixen (V) dovetail and holds it securely.</p>\\n<p>The hand controller is neatly integrated into the fork arm and can be removed if necessary. The telescope can also be operated comfortably when it is in the fork arm holder.</p>\\n<p><strong>Power supply:</strong><br>The computer control is of course dependent on electricity. The mount offers several options for power supply: Either via eight standard AA batteries if you want to be completely independent, or via an optional connection cable for the cigarette lighter socket of a car or via an optional power supply unit. The battery compartment integrated into the mount avoids cable clutter and enables maximum mobility.</p>\\n<p><strong>* Important: Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong></p>\\n<p>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case.</p>\\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optical design: Schmidt-Cassegrain<br></li>\\n<li>Optical coating: Starbright XLT (Fully multi-coated)<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution (DAWES): 0..57 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution (RAYLEIGH): 0.69 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Focal length: 2032mm<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction: 6.4cm<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction relative to diameter: 31.00%<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction relative to surface: 9.77%<br></li>\\n<li>Visual field: 0.63 °<br></li>\\n<li>Limit size: 14<br></li>\\n<li>Highest useful magnification: x480<br></li>\\n<li>Light gathering capacity (compared to the human eye): x843<br></li>\\n<li>Linear Field of View (@1000 yds): 33 ft<br></li>\\n<li>Lowest useful magnification: x29<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope aperture: 203.2mm (8\")<br></li>\\n<li>Focuser size (inches): 1.25“<br></li>\\n<li>Tube length: 43cm<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture ratio: f/10</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Mount Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Connections: USB on the hand controller, Aux port<br></li>\\n<li>Multi-language: Yes</li>\\n<li>GPS: with optional SkySync module<br></li>\\n<li>Hand controller: NexStar+ hand controller, two-line LCD display with 16 characters, 19 backlit keys, USB 2.0 port for PC connection<br></li>\\n<li>Power requirements: 8-AA batteries (not included), optional power supply<br></li>\\n<li>Alignment Methods: SkyAlign, Auto 2-Star Align, 1-Star Align, 2-Star Align, Solar System Align<br></li>\\n<li>Database: Over 38,000+ properties, 100 custom listings, More information on over 200 properties<br></li>\\n<li>Mount: Azimuthal mount (motorized)<br></li>\\n<li>Mount control: Computer controlled (GOTO)<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking speeds: Sidereal, solar and lunar<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking modes: Azimuthal, EQ-North, EQ-South<br></li>\\n<li>Dovetail compatible: EQ Standard (Vixen Style)<br></li>\\n<li>Panning speed: Nine speeds<br></li>\\n<li>Mount Type: Alt-Azimuth single-arm mount</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Focal length eyepiece: 25mm</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Incl. accessories: 8\" Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, pre-assembled steel tripod, accessory tray, computer-controlled Nexstar 6/8SE mount with NexStar hand controller, StarPointer red dot finder, 25mm eyepiece, 1.25\" star diagonal prism, cigarette lighter cable</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Viewfinder: StarPointer</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Zenith prism: 1.25\"</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li><em>Accessory tray: with eyepiece tray</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000276-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 2278.11, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Celestron-Nexstar-8SE_2.webp?v=1727284492', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The steel tripod has markings so you can easily extend all legs to the same length. The azimuth and elevation clamps allow you to point the telescope at a target even without power. Up to seven eyepieces can be stored in two storage compartments - one even has a dimmable red LED light.</p>\\n<p>More power and safety thanks to lithium iron phosphate battery:<br>Instead of a typical lithium polymer battery, a lithium iron phosphate battery is used in the Evolution telescopes.

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'Celestron AVX - C6', 'Type': '6\" Schmidt Cassegrain', 'Body (HTML)': '<p><strong><br>This 6\" Schmidt-Cassegrain not only has the StarBright XLT coating for clear images, but also high-quality Schmidt-Cassegrain optics with a 1500mm focal length (f/10) and a 15cm aperture, meaning it collects 40% more light than a 5\" telescope.</strong></p>\\n<p>The Advanced VX is designed as an ideal platform for astrophotography with smaller telescopes. For telescopes up to approx. 13.6kg (depending on the lever), the sophisticated functions of this large parallactic mount is now also available. Thanks to PEC (Periodic Error Correction), the periodic worm error that occurs in all mounts with classic worm gears can be compensated, so that long-exposure shots are easily carried out. You can also track objects far beyond the meridian without having to immediately turn carry out a meridian flip. This means you can observe the most interesting part of the sky without interruption. The Advanced VX also has a much wider base than its predecessor, which further increases stability even with large loads. The improved motors have a higher torque and can better compensate for slight imbalances.</p>\\n<p>Since spring 2019, it has been delivered with the dual dovetail clamp , so that both telescopes with the small CG5 rail (EQ standard) and the large CGE rail (3\" standard) fit on the AVX - without additional adapters! All you have to do is move the clamping screws. Larger telescopes in particular benefit from the wider rail, which offers more stability.</p>\\n<p><em>Third-party dovetail plates:</em><br>The Advanced VX is still compatible with Vixen format dovetail rails. However, the rail must be at least 100mm long as the clamping points on the new AVX are 90mm apart. If a user wants to use the AVX with a telescope that has a Vixen (or CG-5) dovetail rail that is shorter than 100mm, the rail must be replaced with a longer dovetail rail however suitable rails are available separately.</p>\\n<p>The new AVX mount is not compatible with Losmandy D format dovetail rails. The CGE and Losmandy D formats are similar but not identical. Losmandy rails are about a millimeter wider, while CGE plates are deeper and have more surface contact with the dovetail clamp. To use an AVX with a telescope with a Losmandy D dovetail rail, the existing rail must also be replaced with a compatible dovetail rail.</p>\\n<p><em>State-of-the-art technology for mobile use:</em><br>Celestron Advanced VX mounts set a new standard for medium-sized telescopes up to 13.6kg. The mount was developed from scratch, always with astrophotography in mind. It offers many of the features of the large Celestron mounts at a very attractive price.</p>\\n<p><em>Solid cast parts and heavy-duty mechanics:</em><br>Based on the proven Advanced GT mount, the Advanced VX not only offers large, easy-to-grip adjustment screws and more powerful motors that can cope even better with unevenly distributed loads, but also a wider base for the tripod connection and an improved dual dovetail mount with two clamping screws. No premature tilting! Tracking is possible up to 20° beyond the meridian passage.</p>\\n<p><em>State-of-the-art software:</em><br>The AVX mount is supplied with the cold-resistant, much more powerful NexStar+ hand controller. This means you have a modern computer control system at your disposal - with over 40,000 objects stored. Thanks to the built-in clock, setup is even faster than before. The software automatically moves to the reference stars, you only have to center them in the eyepiece.</p>\\n<p>Advanced VX mounts can be controlled via Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software via the PC connection on the hand controller</p>\\n<p><em>Orientation made easy:</em><br>With the AVX, you no longer have to laboriously adjust the North Star using the polar finder scope: Align the mount roughly to the north, perform a 2-star alignment - and then call up the All-Star Polar Alignment. The software now helps you to align the mount precisely to the north, even if you cannot see the North Star. You can look comfortably through the telescope and do not have to kneel under the polar finder scope (which is still available as an option).</p>\\n<p><em>Versatile &amp; Future proof:</em><br>In addition to an RS232 port, the AVX also has an autoguider input and two AUX ports. Here you can connect additional, separately available expansion modules - for example the SkyPortal WiFi module for control via WLAN with iPhone/iPad/Windows PC or the StarSense module, with which the mount automatically moves to its reference stars and centers them perfectly.</p>\\n<p>Experienced photographers will appreciate how easily this mount can be transported to a dark observing site. If you are new to astronomy or astrophotography, the Advanced VX will make it easy to get started and will serve you well for many years to come.</p>\\n<p><strong>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong><br>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case. We also have a range of power supply adapters available for these mounts and many others, just contact us.</p>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optical design: Schmidt-Cassegrain<br></li>\\n<li>Optical coating: Starbright XLT (Fully multi-coated)<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope aperture: 150mm (5.91\")<br></li>\\n<li>Focuser size (inches): 1.25\"<br></li>\\n<li>Tube (material): Aluminum<br></li>\\n<li>Tube weight: 4.5kg (10lbs)<br></li>\\n<li>Tube length: 16\" (406mm)<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture ratio: f/10<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution (DAWES): 0.77 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution (RAYLEIGH): 0.93 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Focal length: 1500mm (59in)<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction: 5.6cm</li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction relative to diameter: 37.00%<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction relative to surface: 14.00%<br></li>\\n<li>Visual field: 0.83°<br></li>\\n<li>Limit size: 13.4<br></li>\\n<li>Highest useful magnification: x354<br></li>\\n<li>Light gathering capacity (compared to the human eye): x459<br></li>\\n<li>Lowest useful magnification: x21</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Mount Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span>Alignment Methods: 2-Star Align, 1-Star Align, Solar System Align, Last Alignment, Quick Align</span></li>\\n<li>Database: Over 120000 objects, including 220 of the most beautiful deep sky and solar system targets<br></li>\\n<li>Counterweights: 1 x 12 lbs<br></li>\\n<li>Mount: Equatorial mount (motorized)<br></li>\\n<li>Mount weight (EQ): 7.7kg<br></li>\\n<li>Mount control: Computer controlled (GOTO)<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking speeds: Sidereal, solar and lunar<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking modes: EQ North and EQ South<br></li>\\n<li>Pole height adjustment: 7-77°<br></li>\\n<li>Screw Error Control (PPEC): PEC, permanently programmable<br></li>\\n<li>Dovetail compatible: Dual dovetail rail (CG-5 and CGE plate)<br></li>\\n<li>Panning speed: 9 speeds, maximum 4°/s<br></li>\\n<li>Carrying capacity: 13.6 kg (30 lbs)<br></li>\\n<li>Connections: RS-232 on the hand controller<br></li>\\n<li>Hand controller: NexStar+ hand controller, two-line LCD display with 16 characters, 19 backlit keys, USB 2.0 port for PC connection<br></li>\\n<li>Motor drive: Low cog DC servo motors<br></li>\\n<li>Power requirements: 12V DC, 3.5A</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Focal length eyepiece: 20mm</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Incl. accessories: 6\" Telescope, Advanced VX mount, steel tripod, one eyepiece, hand controller, counterweight</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Viewfinder: 6x30</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Zenith prism: 1.25\"</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li><em>Accessory tray: Yes</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000279-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 2176.8, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Celestron-AVX-C6_1.webp?v=1727291485', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The telescope is perfect for visual observations and, with an optional polar wedge and an astro camera, also enables professional astrophotography.</strong></p>\\n<p>If you point the telescope at the planets, you\\'ll see fascinating details on the surface of Jupiter, the Cassini division of Saturn\\'s rings, and surface details on Mars. Even Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are within your reach.</p>\\n<p>Despite the large aperture, the telescope is so portable thanks to the practical carrying handle and a weight of around 19kg so that you can set it up easily in your garden as well as in your favorite spot under a dark sky.</p>\\n<p><em>Professional XLT computer telescopes:</em><br>With the CPC series, Celestron is introducing the most stable fork mount that has ever been available in the 40 years of production of Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. The completely newly designed tripod and a huge 280mm ball bearing in the fork base enable vibration-free observation even at the highest magnifications.</p>\\n<p>The azimuthal fork mount is not as variable as the German mount, as it is tailored to the tube diameter. This disadvantage is compensated for by the compact design, low weight, good portability\\xa0and, most importantly, incredibly quick setup. You are ready to observe in just a few minutes. Simply set up the tripod, level it with the built-in bubble level, put on the fork mount - and switch it on.</p>\\n<p><em>Built-in GPS:</em><br>The 16-channel GPS receiver transmits the time, date and location coordinates to the electronics. This means you no longer have to enter the time and location yourself - the telescope automatically has the exact data.</p>\\n<p><em>Sky Align:</em><br>This is the name of the brand new alignment process from Celestron for perfect GoTo positioning. The telescope no longer needs a defined base position: you place three bright stars (planets and the moon are also possible) in the field of view of the telescope one after the other and voilá, your CPC telescope is ready for automatic GoTo positioning on any object from the hand control database.</p>\\n<p>SkyAlign calculates the setup of your telescope from the travel distances of the three stars and the corresponding angles. SkyAlign also gets the other data required (date, time, and location coordinates) via the integrated 16-channel GPS receiver.</p>\\n<p>\"SkyAlign\" only works when the telescope is in azimuthal operation, i.e. when the telescope is operated directly on the tripod without a polar wedge. But Celestron also has some new and simplified alignment methods for parallactic operation in the CPC series.</p>\\n<p><em>Extensive database:</em><br>The CPC telescope database contains over 40,000 celestial objects, including the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as galaxies and nebulae from the NGC catalog and the planets. You can narrow down your selection to make searching this comprehensive database easier and to hide objects that are currently below the horizon.</p>\\n<p>The \"Identify\" function tells you what you are currently seeing in the telescope and also allows you to easily explore the sky. Simply point the telescope at any area of \\u200b\\u200bthe sky and have it show you, for example, the nearest Messier objects - the telescope will navigate to them for you. You can do this in different areas of the sky and with different objects!</p>\\n<p><em>The CPC telescopes also score points with the following details:</em><br>The azimuthal fork mount has been completely redesigned. It is less susceptible to vibrations and the drive motors and gears run \"whisper quiet\" in GoTo mode. The tripod that supports the mount and telescope has also become more stable.<br>The completely newly designed tripod (landing pad) has a self-centering mounting device - no searching in the dark for the right attachment point for the mounting foot on the tripod. By rotating the mount on the tripod, the screw holes lock into the right position. Three spring-supported screws, which are anchored in the tripod, enable quick and, above all, effortless assembly in a matter of seconds. The built-in bubble level makes leveling easier. The large tripod triangle also serves as a storage area for several eyepieces.</p>\\n<p><em>Other features include:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Illuminated on/off switch on the top of the housing - so no more searching in the dark,<br></li>\\n<li>Large, easy-to-grip clamping wheels (suitable for gloves) in both axles instead of fiddly small clamping levers,<br></li>\\n<li>The \"Permanent PEC\" function stores the periodic errors of the screw to improve the tracking accuracy,<br></li>\\n<li>The electronics work with all autoguiders and planetarium programs available on the market,<br></li>\\n<li>The \"Alignment Sync\" function allows you to improve positioning accuracy during operation by confirming a new alignment object,<br></li>\\n<li>The \"Precise Goto\" function allows very faint objects to be brought extremely precisely into the center of the field of view or a CCD chip. First, a bright star close to the object being searched for is selected by the electronics and moved to it. The observer must then move it precisely to the center of the field of view using the arrow keys on the hand controller. The computer then calculates the distance from this star to the object being searched for and moves to it with high precision.<br></li>\\n<li>Finally, another new \"feature\" of the hand controls of version 4.0 of the CPC series: thanks to a flash EPROM, the control and motor software can be upgraded via the Internet.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong><br>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case.

With over 9 inches of aperture and our premium StarBright XLT coatings, the CGEM II 925 HD gives you over 1000 times the light gathering power than the unaided eye. </strong></p>\\n<p>Designed to give diffraction limited performance and offer more resolution than the 800 with less weight than the 1100, the CGEM II 925 HD is a premier astroimaging telescope.</p>\\n<p><strong>Optical Tube Info:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>See the Universe in HD:</em><br>EdgeHD is an aplanatic, flat field Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope that produces aberration-free images across a wide visual and photographic field of view. The optical system was designed to reduce more than just off-axis star coma; it also provides an astrograph-quality flat focal plane all the way to the edge of the field of view.</p>\\n<p><em>True Astrograph Quality:</em><br>Many optical designs that advertise themselves as \"astrographs\" actually only produce pinpoint stars across a curved focal plane. While this may be acceptable for some visual observing, stars will appear out of focus at the edge when used with the flat chip sensor of a digital camera. EdgeHD optics produce a focal plane more than three-times flatter than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and dramatically flatter than competing coma-free designs. This guarantees you visibly sharp stars across some of the largest CCD chips available today. Learn more about EdgeHD technology.</p>\\n<p><em>Improved Performance:</em><br>Superior edge performance not only creates rounder, more pleasing stars, but actually improves the resolution and limiting magnitude when compared to telescopes of equal aperture. With Celestron’s StarBright XLT optical coatings on every surface, EdgeHD optics gives you maximum light throughput across the widest visual and photographic spectrum.</p>\\n<p><em>Mechanical Features:</em><br>In addition to EdgeHD’s optimized optical design, the telescope tube has been redesigned to make sure you get the most from your optics each and every night.</p>\\n<p>Mirror clutches - Flexible tension clutches hold the mirror in place and reduce image shift when taking long exposure astro-images. Once focused, the flexible rods allow the mirror to be held in place without putting any force or pressure on the mirror assembly, keeping the image centered in the eyepiece (or on the sensor).<br>Tube vents - Cooling vents located on the rear cell allow hot air to be released from behind the primary mirror. Each vent has an integrated 50-mesh filter guaranteed to let warm air out without letting dust in.<br>Fastar versatility - EdgeHD is the most versatile imaging telescope available today. At its native f/10, you can achieve the image scale necessary to capture the smallest of deep sky objects. A Barlow gives you added power for high-resolution planetary, lunar and solar imaging. All EdgeHD optical tubes are Fastar-compatible, allowing the secondary mirror to be removed and replaced with a third party lens accessory for ultra-fast f/2 wide field imaging.<br>Individually Tested<br>Every EdgeHD that ships has been tested not only for the surface quality of each optical component, but also with a camera and artificial star to ensure the imaging system meets our rigid quality assurance.

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'Celestron CGX - 9.25 EdgeHD', 'Type': '9.25\" Schmidt Cassegrain', 'Body (HTML)': '<p><br><strong>The CGX mount only looks similar to the cheaper CGEM-II at first glance, but it has been completely redesigned and offers many more features.</strong></p>\\n<p>The 20kg mount has a real photographic payload of 25kg, so you can really work with 25kg payload and don\\'t have to plan for generous reserves for photography, as is often the case. Thanks to the large carrying handles, it is even easier to transport than a comparable, slightly lighter classic parallactic mount! With the dual dovetail clamp for CG-5 (Vixen, Celestron) or CGE (3-inch), you can easily switch between small solar telescopes and large Schmidt-Cassegrains, for example.</p>\\n<p>The mount has been given more powerful, faster-reacting motors that are connected to the axes via a sturdy toothed belt. This means the mount responds almost immediately to control commands, even from an autoguider. There is no play in the gears, and since the worm gears are also spring-loaded, the play is largely eliminated - you don\\'t have to readjust even when there are large temperature differences, as the worms and gears have optimal contact.</p>\\n<p>The new, large screws are easy to grip, so you can loosen or tighten them easily even when wearing gloves - the polar height adjustment has also been revised so that you can easily adjust the mount even when it is fully loaded. A polar finder will be available as an option, but is generally unnecessary: \\u200b\\u200bWith the All-Star Polaralign you can align the mount to any brighter star through the telescope, and for perfection, the polar finder has always been superior to the polar finder. As a special feature, you can move the mount on the base plate of the extra-wide tripod head - this allows you to position the center of gravity perfectly over the tripod, for the entire usable latitude range from 3 to 65° north or south latitude. The flat base can also be easily adapted to your own columns. Celestron provides a flange drawing ( PDF ) for fixed installation.</p>\\n<p>As a photo mount, it is just as suitable for mobile use as it is for remote operation. Internal sensors (“switches”) automatically bring the mount into the home position and prevent it from moving too far and hitting something when panning. The internal cabling also serves to ensure safety: all connections (power, hand controller, AUX and autoguider) are in the base of the mount and do not move with it.</p>\\n<p>The hand controller can be controlled in the traditional way via ASCOM and the hand controller (new: with USB connection) via PC, or you can use the control software included in the delivery, which was developed together with Planewave Instruments. Multipoint GoTo modeling, plate solving and control of the focuser are just a few functions that you normally have to add for remote operation - with the CGX this software is included in the delivery. Here you do not need the hand controller, but can use the USB connection on the mount directly.</p>\\n<p><em>The Telescope Optics:<br></em>The EdgeHD optics (Edge High Definition) combine the compact design of a Schmidt-Cassegrain with significantly improved imaging at the edge of the image. This optical system not only offers the properties of astrographs, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view. Not only is the coma outside the optical axis corrected - as with other so-called \"coma-free\" optical designs available on the market (see also our test image) - but also the field curvature!</p>\\n<p>Many optical systems are promoted as \"astrographs\"; however, they produce the coveted \"pinpoint\" star image along a curved image plane. On images taken with modern CCD cameras, the result is a noticeable field curvature that increases towards the edge of the image field and becomes stronger the larger the chip is; i.e. the stars remain round, but are blown up into small rings (\"donuts\") towards the edge.</p>\\n<p>With the Celestron Edge HD telescopes, this field curvature is corrected right up to the edge in addition to the coma, so that even images taken with large CCD chips are completely sharp, with a uniformly large star image across the entire chip - right into the corners of the image field.</p>\\n<p>This also significantly improves the resolution and limiting magnitude compared to competing optical systems with a similar aperture. The Celestron XLT multi-coating also helps the Edge HD optics to achieve a significant increase in performance compared to similar systems on the market.</p>\\n<p><em>In addition to the new optics, the mechanics and tube have also been completely redesigned. The new features include:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Mirror locks hold the main mirror in any focus position without exerting pressure on the optical elements. The image always remains stable on the chip, even with long exposure times.<br></li>\\n<li>Ventilation openings behind the main mirror ensure rapid air exchange, so that the optics cool down at an unrivalled speed. Thanks to an air filter system, no dust gets into the tube.<br></li>\\n<li>HyperStar Compatible – All EdgeHD tubes allow you to remove the secondary mirror and replace it with the optional HyperStar optics. The result: your standard Celestron EdgeHD telescope becomes a digital Schmidt Design for your CCD or DSLR camera for primary focus photography at f/2 (C8, C11) and f/1.9 (C14).<br>To learn more about this system, visit the dedicated EdgeHD website .<br></li>\\n<li>Adapted telecompressors (f/7.5) and Barlow lenses (f/20) are under development.<br></li>\\n<li>Axiom eyepieces - The Edge HD 9.25 comes with an Axiom eyepiece from Celestron.

The mount was developed with the requirements of astrophotography \\xa0in mind. The Advanced VX offers many of the features of the large Celestron equatorial mounts, and at a very attractive price point.</strong></p>\\n<p>The Advanced VX is designed as an ideal platform for astrophotography with smaller telescopes (telescopes up to approx. 13kg - depending on the lever). Thanks to PEC (Periodic Error Correction), the periodic worm error that occurs in all mounts with classic worm gears can be compensated for, so that longer-exposure shots are also possible. You can also track objects far beyond the meridian without having to immediately carry out a Meridian Flip. This means you can observe the most interesting part of the sky without any interruption. The Advanced VX also has a much wider base than its predecessor, which further increases stability even with large loads. The improved motors have a higher torque and can better compensate for slight imbalances.</p>\\n<p>Since spring 2019, it has also included the dual dovetail clamp, so that both telescopes with the small CG5 rail (EQ standard) and the large CGE rail (3\" standard) fit on the AVX - without additional adapters! All you have to do is move the clamping screws. Larger telescopes in particular benefit from the wider rail, which offers more stability.</p>\\n<p><em>Third-party dovetail plates:</em><br>The Advanced VX is still compatible with Vixen format dovetail rails. However, the rail must be at least 100mm long as the clamping points on the new AVX are 90mm apart. If a user wants to use the AVX with a telescope that has a Vixen (or CG-5) dovetail rail that is shorter than 100mm, the rail must be replaced with a longer dovetail rail however suitable rails are also available from us.</p>\\n<p>The new AVX mount is not compatible with Losmandy D format dovetail rails. The CGE and Losmandy D formats are similar but not identical. Losmandy rails are about a millimeter wider, while CGE plates are deeper and have more surface contact with the dovetail clamp. To use an AVX with a telescope with a Losmandy D dovetail rail, the existing rail must be replaced with a compatible dovetail rail. Suitable rails are available from us.</p>\\n<p><em>Solid cast parts and heavy-duty mechanics:</em><br>Based on the proven Advanced GT mount, the Advanced VX not only offers large, easy-to-grip adjustment screws as well as more powerful motors that can cope better with unevenly distributed loads, but it also has a wider base for the tripod connection and an improved dual dovetail mount with two clamping screws. No premature tilting! Tracking is also possible up to 20° beyond the meridian passage.</p>\\n<p><em>State-of-the-art software:</em><br>The AVX mount is supplied with the cold-resistant, much more powerful NexStar+ hand controller. This means you have a modern computer control system at your disposal - with over 40,000 objects and multi-lingual navigation menu. Thanks to the built-in clock, setting up is even faster than before. The software automatically moves to the reference stars, you only have to center them in the eyepiece. Even the sun can serve as a reference object.</p>\\n<p>Advanced VX mounts can be also controlled via Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software via the PC connection on the hand controller</p>\\n<p><em>Orientation made easy:</em><br>With the AVX, you no longer have to laboriously adjust to the North Star using the polar finder scope: Align the mount roughly to the north, perform a 2-star alignment - and then call up the All-Star Polar Alignment. The software will then help you to align the mount precisely to the north, even if you cannot see the North Star. You can look comfortably through the telescope and do not have to kneel under the polar finder scope (which is still available as an option).</p>\\n<p><em>Versatile expandable:</em><br>In addition to a USB port on the hand controller, the AVX also has an autoguider input and two AUX ports. Here you can connect additional, separately available expansion modules - for example the SkyPortal WiFi module for control via WLAN with iPhone/iPad/Windows PC or the StarSense module , with which the mount automatically moves to its reference stars and centers them perfectly.</p>\\n<p>Experienced photographers will appreciate how easily this mount can be transported to a dark observing site. If you are new to astronomy or astrophotography, the Advanced VX will make it easy to get started and will serve you well for many years to come.</p>\\n<p><strong>Mount Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Alignment Methods: 2-Star Align, 1-Star Align, Solar System Align, Last Alignment, Quick Align<br></li>\\n<li>Database: 40,000+ objects, 100 custom programmable objects.

To make this suitable for photography too, the mount has been given more powerful, responsive motors that are connected to the axes via a sturdy toothed belt. This means that the mount responds almost immediately to control commands, even from an autoguider. There is no play in the gears, and since the worm gears are also spring-loaded, the play is largely eliminated - you do not have to readjust even in the event of large temperature differences, as the worms and gears have optimal contact.</p>\\n<p>The new, large screws are easy to grip, so you can loosen or tighten them easily even when wearing gloves - the polar height adjustment has also been revised so that you can easily adjust the mount even when it is fully loaded. A polar finder is available available as an option, but is generally unnecessary: \\u200b\\u200bWith the All-Star Polaralign you can align the mount to any brighter star through the telescope, and for perfection, the Polaralign option has always been superior to the standard polar finder. As a special feature, you can move the mount on the base plate of the extra-wide tripod head - this allows you to position the center of gravity perfectly over the tripod, for the entire usable latitude range from 3 to 65° north or south latitude.</p>\\n<p>As a photographic mount, it is just as suitable for mobile use as it is for remote operation. Internal sensors (\"switches\") automatically bring the mount into the home position and prevent it from moving too far and hitting something when panning. The internal cabling also serves to ensure safety: all connections (power, hand controller, AUX and autoguider) are in the base of the mount and do not move with it.</p>\\n<p>The hand controller can be controlled in the traditional way via ASCOM and the hand controller (with USB connection) via PC, or you can use the control software included as a download, which was developed together with Planewave Instruments. Multipoint GoTo modeling, plate solving and control of the focuser are just a few functions that you normally have to add for remote operation - with the CGX this software is included.</p>\\n<p><em>Improved tripod:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Wider tripod head for more stability<br></li>\\n<li>Position of the mount head on the tripod is adjustable to optimally place the center of gravity above the tripod and to optimally utilize the large latitude range of 3-65°<br></li>\\n<li>Dual dovetail mount for CG-5/EQ and CGE/3\" standard<br></li>\\n<li>2\" heavy-duty steel tripod with markings for quick height adjustment<br></li>\\n<li>Universal tray with recesses for three 1.25\" eyepieces, two 2\" eyepieces, a smartphone or other accessories<br></li>\\n<li>Tripod legs can be folded without removing the accessory tray</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><em>Improved ergonomics:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Two handles for easier transport and assembly<br></li>\\n<li>Non-slip clamps for dovetail clamping<br></li>\\n<li>Innovative and improved system for north alignment<br></li>\\n<li>Revised adjustment mechanism for the polar height, even with a fully loaded mount.<br></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><em>Improved Electronics:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>NexStar+ hand controller with USB connection<br></li>\\n<li>Two AUX sockets, e.g. for control via WiFi with optional SkyPortal module or automatic alignment with StarSense module (both modules are available separately but are not included, these can be purchased seperately)<br></li>\\n<li>USB 2.0 socket for direct connection to a PC<br></li>\\n<li>Autoguider connection<br></li>\\n<li>PPEC Ready - for automatic correction of periodic screw error<br></li>\\n<li>12V power connection<br></li>\\n<li>Internal Real Time Clock</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>Mount Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Mount: Equatorial mount (motorized)<br></li>\\n<li>Mount weight (EQ): 20kg<br></li>\\n<li>Mount control: Computer controlled (GOTO)<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking speeds: Sidereal, Solar and Lunar<br></li>\\n<li>Pole height adjustment: 3º-65º<br></li>\\n<li>Panning speed: 5º/sec (4º/sec is standard)<br></li>\\n<li>Features: New PC software to control the telescope<br></li>\\n<li>Payload capacity (kg): 25kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><em>Incl. accessories: CGX Mount Head, Tripod, Accessory Tray, 1 x Counterweight.</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000294-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 3240.4, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Celestron-CGX-Mount_1.webp?v=1727359137', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'Celestron Equatorial Mount - CGX L', 'Type': 'Astrophotography Payload > 34kg', 'Body (HTML)': '<p><strong>The CGX-L mount is the big brother of the CGX and has a very large payload capacity of up to 34kg - enough for even the largest Observatory grade Telescopes and accessories. With a weight of less than 24kg for the mount and 21kg for the tripod, it is still possible to transport thanks to the large carry handles and modular design.</strong></p>\\n<p>The CGX-L was developed for small observatories and remote operations, with a focus on a good payload-to-weight ratio, a compact design and innovative details for the use of large telescopes, photo equipment and the latest wireless accessories.</p>\\n<p>A key role is played by the generously dimensioned 144mm worm gears, which enable smoother running even with heavy telescopes, and the dovetail clamp, which has been extended to 270mm also holds large telescopes securely. For remote operation, there are optical sensors for the home and limit positions, simplified settings for north alignment and improved cable routing. There are also mechanical and ergonomic improvements that make the mount even more stable, user-friendly and transportable.</p>\\n<p>With the dual dovetail clamp for CG-5 (Vixen, Celestron) or CGE (3-inch), you can easily switch between smaller telescopes and large Schmidt-Cassegrains, for example. For Astrophotography, the mount has powerful responsive motors that are connected to the axes via a sturdy toothed belt. This means the mount responds almost immediately to control commands, even from an autoguider. There is no play in the gears, and since the worm gears are also spring-loaded, the play is largely eliminated - you don\\'t have to readjust even when there are large temperature differences, the worms and gears have optimal contact.</p>\\n<p>The large screws are easy to grip, so you can loosen or tighten them easily even when wearing gloves - the polar height adjustment has also been redesigned so that you can easily adjust the mount even when it is fully loaded. A polar finder is available as an option, but is generally unnecessary: \\u200b\\u200bWith the All-Star Polaralign you can align the mount to any brighter star through the telescope, and for perfection, the Polaralign function has always been superior to the standard polar finder. As a special feature, you can move the mount on the base plate of the extra-wide tripod head - this allows you to position the center of gravity perfectly over the tripod, for the entire usable latitude range from 3 to 65° north or south latitude.</p>\\n<p>As a photographic mount, it is just as suitable for mobile use as it is for remote operation. Internal sensors (\"switches\") automatically bring the mount into the home position and prevent it from moving too far and hitting something when panning. The internal cabling also serves to ensure safety: all connections (power, hand controller, AUX and autoguider) are in the base of the mount and do not move with it.</p>\\n<p>The hand controller can be controlled in the traditional way via ASCOM and the hand controller (with USB connection) via PC, or you can use the control software included as a download in the scope of delivery, which was developed together with Planewave Instruments. Multipoint GoTo modeling, plate solving and control of the focuser are just a few functions that you normally have to add for remote operation - with the CGX this software is included in the scope of delivery. Here you do not need the hand controller, but can use the USB connection on the mount directly.</p>\\n<p><em>Mount features at a glance:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Compact, low-profile mounting head for greater stability and better portability. More stable and rigid with shorter settling time.<br>Improved motors with more torque for better swiveling and tracking even with heavy loads<br></li>\\n<li>Heavy-duty toothed belts minimize gear play and enable short reaction times even with heavy loads<br></li>\\n<li>Viewing windows in the motor housings show the activity of the drives<br></li>\\n<li>Spring-loaded worm gears made of measurement and stainless steel reduce friction and increase the accuracy of fit<br></li>\\n<li>Internal wiring, power and lower connectors do not move when the mount pans<br></li>\\n<li>Home and limit switches – internal hardware stops for RA and Dec to avoid cable clutter and collisions with the tripod<br></li>\\n<li>Internal optical sensors on both axes for easy and safe remote operation<br></li>\\n<li>Home sensors allow the mount to always return to the home position, regardless of the position it was in before the power was interrupted<br></li>\\n<li>Limit sensors automatically interrupt tracking or panning before the mechanical stops are reached<br></li>\\n<li>Includes the sophisticated PWI control software developed in conjunction with Planewave Instruments. Handles multi-point go-to modeling, focusing and plate solving. No additional control software is required, saving you hundreds of euros!<br>Software-assisted polar alignment: \"All-Star Polar Alignment\" enables quick and very precise polar alignment. Use any bright star without additional accessories or apps.<br></li>\\n<li>Position of the mount head on the tripod is adjustable to optimally place the center of gravity above the tripod and to optimally utilize the large latitude range of 3-65°<br></li>\\n<li>Dual dovetail mount for CG-5/EQ/Vixen and CGE/3\" standard<br></li>\\n<li>Tracks up to 20º on either side of the meridian, supports SkyPortal WiFi and StarSense AutoAlign modules.<br></li>\\n<li>Tripod legs can be folded without removing the accessory tray.<br></li>\\n<li>Revised tripod with larger spread angle for more stability.

This optical system not only offers the properties of astrographs, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view. Not only is the coma outside of the optical axis corrected - but also the field curvature!</p>\\n<p>Many optical systems are promoted as \"astrographs\", however, they produce the coveted \"pinpoint\" star image along a curved image plane. On images taken with modern CCD cameras, the result is a noticeable field curvature that increases towards the edge of the image field and becomes stronger the larger the chip is; i.e. the stars remain round, but are blown up into small rings (\"donuts\") towards the edge.</p>\\n<p>With the Celestron Edge HD telescopes, this field curvature is corrected right up to the edge in addition to the coma, so that even images taken with large CCD chips are able to remain completely sharp right into the corners of the image field.</p>\\n<p>This also significantly improves resolution and limiting magnitude compared to competing optical systems with a similar aperture. The Celestron XLT multi-coating also helps the Edge HD optics to achieve a significant increase in performance compared to similar systems on the market.</p>\\n<p>The EdgeHD optics produces a three-times flatter image in the field plane than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain. The stars are imaged diffraction-limited across the entire chip of a Nikon D3 or Canon 5D for example.</p>\\n<p><em>In addition to the new optics, the mechanics and tube have also been completely redesigned. The new features include:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Mirror locks to hold the main mirror in any focus position without exerting pressure on the optical elements. The image always remains stable on the chip, even with long exposure times.<br></li>\\n<li>Ventilation openings behind the main mirror ensure rapid air exchange, so that the optics cool down at a much faster rate. Thanks to an air filter system, no dust gets into the tube either.<br></li>\\n<li>HyperStar Compatible - All EdgeHD tubes allow you to remove the secondary mirror and replace it with the optional HyperStar optics.

Not only is the coma outside of the optical axis corrected - but also the field curvature!</p>\\n<p>Many optical systems are promoted as \"astrographs\", however, they produce the coveted \"pinpoint\" star image along a curved image plane. On images taken with modern CCD cameras, the result is a noticeable field curvature that increases towards the edge of the image field and becomes stronger the larger the chip is; i.e. the stars remain round, but are blown up into small rings (\"donuts\") towards the edge.</p>\\n<p>With the Celestron Edge HD telescopes, this field curvature is corrected right up to the edge in addition to the coma, so that even images taken with large CCD chips are able to remain completely sharp right into the corners of the image field.</p>\\n<p>This also significantly improves resolution and limiting magnitude compared to competing optical systems with a similar aperture. The Celestron XLT multi-coating also helps the Edge HD optics to achieve a significant increase in performance compared to similar systems on the market.</p>\\n<p>The EdgeHD optics produces a three-times flatter image in the field plane than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain.

With these telescopes you do not have to settle for any compromises. UNC stands for Universal Newtonian telescope with Carbon tube. Each UNC Newtonian is individually manufactured for you in Germany.</strong></p>\\n<p>The 8\" f/6 UNC Newtonian is a specialist for moon and planets but also good for deep-sky observing. For the moon and planets only the atmosphere limits the resolution of the telescope, as the regular small secondary mirror provides a high contrast due to the low obstruction of only 25%.</p>\\n<p>Deep sky images with high detail resolution and high contrast, typically common with high quality APO Refractors, are also within your reach as the secondary mirror offers 100% illumination at 19mm. With flats, sensors up to APS-C format can be used.</p>\\n<p><em>The advantages of the TS UNC Newtonian telescopes:</em><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>High-quality, German-made high quality carbon tube.<br></li>\\n<li>Easy collimation of primary and secondary mirror - by hand, without tools.<br></li>\\n<li>The edge of the secondary mirror is blackened.<br></li>\\n<li>TS UNCN2-G2 2\" rack and pinion focuser with M54x0.75 intermediate thread.<br></li>\\n<li>The secondary is Pre-attached to the secondary mount with the correct offset.<br></li>\\n<li>94% reflectivity on primary mirror and secondary mirror for a brighter image<br></li>\\n<li>Diffraction limited primary mirror - each telescope is tested on an optical bench before shipment</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>The carbon tube - finest precision work:</em><br>The carbon tube is extra solid and completely reinforced, not only around the focuser. This makes the tubes much stiffer and the adjustment stability is high. The openings for the secondary are precisely fitted with turned mating parts, ensuring that the secondary spider vanes are correct and the telescope produces perfect spikes right from the start.</p>\\n<p><em>Focus position optimized for astrophotography:</em><br>The focus point is 135mm above the tube. This allows you to use different focusers and still have a comfortable working distance. With the standard focuser UNCN2-G2 you even get 80mm working distance, this even allows the use of focal reducers or a binoviewer with moderate glass path compensation. For standard correctors we recommend a 20mm spacer, which sits between the focuser. This gives you 60mm backfocus.</p>\\n<p>Note: For visual observation you need a 2\" extension tube - <a>Click here</a>.</p>\\n<p><em>The 2\" TS UNCN2-G2 RAP focuser:</em><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A core component of the TS UNC-Newtons is the modern TS UNCN2-G2 focuser. The focuser builds up only 58mm from the tube edge and still carries heavy cameras and accessories without tilting. The focuser is superior to conventional Crayford focusers.<br></li>\\n<li>High stiffness with extremely short length<br></li>\\n<li>Exact 1:10 dual-speed gear - for perfectly focused astrophotographs<br>Adjustment is decoupled from the ball bearing - a clear advantage over Crayford focusers<br></li>\\n<li>Threaded connection of accessories is possible - the 2\" receptacle can be unscrewed, then an M54x0.75 female thread is available.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Parabolic primary mirror:</em><br>Newtonian primary mirrors made of fused silica are free of strain and provide an image that is usually much better than diffraction limited types. The surface is coated with an enhanced 94% reflection layer and a protective quartz layer. The primary mirror has a central marking as an adjustment aid.</p>\\n<p><em>Primary mirror fan for faster cool-down time:</em><br>A cooling fan to accelerate cool-down time to ambient temperature. Until a mirror is properly cooled down, it will create currents of warm air that will deteriorate the image - no matter which mirror substrate is used. Only after the mirror has cooled down does this effect stop.</p>\\n<p><em>Every TS Carbon Newtonian is tested on our optical bench before shipping:</em><br>These are a solid telescope for life. After assembly, Each UNC Newtonian is subjected to an optical test at the workshop before shipping. This ensures that the telescope will fit your accessories perfectly and will deliver the optical performance promised.</p>\\n<p>Before shipping, the primary mirror with the cell is removed from the tube and packed separately. This is to guarantee a safe shipment and avoid unnecessary transport damages.</p>\\n<p><em>Choose your focus positions and change of secondary mirror diameter:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<span><strong>Focus position No.1</strong></span> - with 60mm above the 2\" receptacle has proven to be very versatile. Nevertheless, we can also offer you individual focus positions and other secondary mirror sizes - Just contact us prior to purchase.<br></li>\\n<li>\\n<span><strong>Focus position No.2</strong></span> - 30mm above the 2\" connection - optimal for visual observation. The secondary mirror can be slightly smaller, we recommend a secondary mirror with 63mm (minor axis) which is sufficient even for 2\" eyepieces.<br></li>\\n<li>\\n<span><strong>Focus position No.3</strong></span> - 90mm above the 2\" connection - this allows you to use a 0.73x reducer/corrector and change the focal ratio from f/6 to f/4.4 (@876mm). The combination is then designed for cameras up to APS-C format. We recommend the secondary mirror with 70mm (minor axis).</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><em>Assembly and collimation instructions:</em><br>The telescope is delivered disassembled into several units for safety.

With these telescopes you do not have to settle for any compromises. UNC stands for Universal Newtonian telescope with Carbon tube. Each UNC Newtonian is individually manufactured for you in Germany. </strong></p>\\n<p><strong>These Telescopes are specially made to order.</strong></p>\\n<p>The 8\" f/4 UNC Newtonian is a compact and transportable all-round telescope. It is ideally suitable for visual observation and astrophotography. Astrophotographers will appreciate fine stars because of the small secondary mirror and in combination with suitable coma-correctors, deep-sky photography are possible in a relatively short time.</p>\\n<p><em>The advantages of the TS UNC Newtonian telescopes:</em><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>High-quality, German-made high quality carbon tube.<br></li>\\n<li>Easy collimation of primary and secondary mirror - by hand, without tools.<br></li>\\n<li>The edge of the secondary mirror is blackened.<br></li>\\n<li>TS UNCN2-G2 2\" rack and pinion focuser with M54x0.75 intermediate thread.<br></li>\\n<li>The secondary is Pre-attached to the secondary mount with the correct offset.<br></li>\\n<li>94% reflectivity on primary mirror and secondary mirror for a brighter image<br></li>\\n<li>Diffraction limited primary mirror - each telescope is tested on an optical bench before shipment</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>The carbon tube - finest precision work:</em><br>The carbon tube is extra solid and completely reinforced, not only around the focuser. This makes the tubes much stiffer and the adjustment stability is high. The openings for the secondary are precisely fitted with turned mating parts, ensuring that the secondary spider vanes are correct and the telescope produces perfect spikes right from the start.</p>\\n<p><em>Focus position optimized for astrophotography:</em><br>The focus point is 135mm above the tube. This allows you to use different focusers and still have a comfortable working distance. With the standard focuser UNCN2-G2 you even get 80mm working distance, this even allows the use of focal reducers or a binoviewer with moderate glass path compensation. For standard correctors we recommend a 20mm spacer, which sits between the focuser. This gives you 60mm backfocus.</p>\\n<p>Note: For visual observation you need a 2\" extension tube - <a>Click here</a>.</p>\\n<p><em>The 2\" TS UNCN2-G2 RAP focuser:</em><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A core component of the TS UNC-Newtons is the modern TS UNCN2-G2 focuser. The focuser builds up only 58mm from the tube edge and still carries heavy cameras and accessories without tilting. The focuser is superior to conventional Crayford focusers.<br></li>\\n<li>High stiffness with extremely short length<br></li>\\n<li>Exact 1:10 dual-speed gear - for perfectly focused astrophotographs.<br>Adjustment is decoupled from the ball bearing - a clear advantage over Crayford focusers<br></li>\\n<li>Threaded connection of accessories is possible - the 2\" receptacle can be unscrewed, then an M54x0.75 female thread is available.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Parabolic primary mirror:</em><br>Newtonian primary mirrors made of fused silica are free of strain and provide an image that is usually much better than diffraction limited types. The surface is coated with an enhanced 94% reflection layer and a protective quartz layer. The primary mirror has a central marking as an adjustment aid.</p>\\n<p><em>Primary mirror fan for faster cool-down time:</em><br>A cooling fan to accelerate cool-down time to ambient temperature. Until a mirror is properly cooled down, it will create currents of warm air that will deteriorate the image - no matter which mirror substrate is used. Only after the mirror has cooled down does this effect stop.</p>\\n<p><em>Every TS Carbon Newtonian is tested on our optical bench before shipping:</em><br>These are a solid telescope for life. After assembly, Each UNC Newtonian is subjected to an optical test at the workshop before shipping. This ensures that the telescope will fit your accessories perfectly and will deliver the optical performance promised.</p>\\n<p>Before shipping, the primary mirror with the cell is removed from the tube and packed separately. This is to guarantee a safe shipment and avoid unnecessary transport damages.</p>\\n<p><em>Choose your focus positions and change of secondary mirror diameter:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<span><strong>Focus position No.1</strong></span> - with 60mm above the 2\" receptacle has proven to be very versatile.

The exposure times during astrophotography can essentially be almost halved. This corrector was designed by H. Ackermann (USA).</p>\\n<p><em>The corrector is usable for the following Newtonian telescopes:</em><br>Basically, the corrector/reducer can be used with all Newtonians from f/3.5 to f/8. It has an M48 thread at the camera side. The adapter shifts back the focal plane by 15-16 millimetres. This value results from the reduction factor of the reducer. You need approximately 85mm from the 2\" receptacle of the focuser to the focus to make the reducer operational. UNC and ONTC Newtonian telescopes from TS Optics can be prepared for the use of this special corrector.</p>\\n<p>Because of the increased speed, you also have to pay attention to accurate clamping because even minimal tilting results directly in unsharp stars at the edge of the field.</p>\\n<p><em>Usable image field of the TS-Optics corrector-reducer:</em><br>The design of the corrector allows for a usable field of 22mm diameter with 100% illumination. With a little trick during focusing, this field can be extended to approx. 30mm - For example, don\\'t use a star in the middle of the field, but use a medium bright one in the outer third of the field.</p>\\n<p><em>Practical tip - how do I get 55mm working distance using this corrector?</em><br>The distance of the corrector is 67mm (+/- 0.5mm) from the M48 connection thread. The working distance is always calculated from the corrector to the camera which is typically 55mm for most cameras :<br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Distance 55mm with T2 connection: Using a 1mm spacing ring , a 5mm Extension , an M48x0.75 to T2 high profile adapter<br></li>\\n<li>Distance 55mm with M48 connection: Using a 1mm spacing ring (x2) , a 10mm Extension</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Barrel size: 2\"<br></li>\\n<li>Connection thread at the camera side: 2\" filter thread (M48x0.75)<br></li>\\n<li>Working distance from the camera thread: 67mm to the sensor (+/- 0.5mm)<br></li>\\n<li>Reduction: Focal length reduced to 0.73x<br></li>\\n<li>Filter thread: 2\" filter thread at the telescope side<br></li>\\n<li>Coating: Fully multi-coated<br></li>\\n<li>Corrected field: 22mm diameter - usable up to 30mm diameter<br></li>\\n<li>Length: 56mm</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>TS Reducer Corrector</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li><em>Dust caps</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000311-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 809.34, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/TSx73ReducerComaCorrectorforNewtonians_5.jpg?v=1735142828', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

      " root - DEBUG - check row(d): {'Title': 'Bresser Sliding Mount for Binoculars', 'Type': 'Sliding Binocular Mount', 'Body (HTML)': \"<p><strong>The Bresser Slider binocular mount, with its revolutionary design, offers unprecedented comfort when observing the night sky with binoculars.</strong></p>\\n<p>The variable extension length of the two support rails (crossbars), the gimbal mounting head and various adjustable slip couplings mean that almost all binocular positions can be effortlessly adjusted. The binoculars then remain in the respective position thanks to the counterweights. During observation, it is usually not necessary to touch the binoculars themselves and regardless of whether you want to observe while standing, sitting on a swivel chair or lying on a sleeping mat or lounger, everything is possible.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>The mount also represents an interesting alternative to normal tripod solutions for wheelchair users, where a tripod leg is usually always in the way. A steady view can be seen despite using larger binoculars. Normally at high magnification and medium-weight binoculars weighing 500 grams or more can be difficult, especially during longer observation periods because after just a short time, \\xa0your arms get tired and trying to maintain a steady view is almost impossible. A high photo tripod with a 360deg ball joint can certainly make a significant improvement but this solution is sometimes limited in terms of the freedom of movement of the binoculars and the position of the observer. \\xa0</p>\\n<p>The Bresser Slider binocular mount offers far more options here and means that almost all desired binocular positions can be reached effortlessly. The patented design with 2 counter-rotating support rails (traverses) is guided on special linear roller bearings inside the mount head with virtually no play. This allows the observer to vary the extension length as desired with little muscle power. The sliding resistance can be continuously adjusted using 2 adjustment screws. In the middle of the center of gravity of the slider mount there is an axis with an adjustable slip clutch for the tilt and rotation movement. All bearings work absolutely smoothly and without play. For quick leveling, there is even a 30mm fluorescent circular bubble level in the mount base, which is easy to read even in the dark.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><em>The Gimbal mount head:</em><br>The gimbal mount head works in a similar way to a ball head. However, it offers a significantly higher load capacity and more stability. Here, too, the sliding resistance of all moving parts can be adjusted to suit the respective needs. The mount head has several mounting holes for mounting a binocular holder using a 1/4 inch photo screw or a standard GP prism clamp for mounting small telescopes. There are also various holes on the side walls of the mount head for additional accessories such as red light reading lamps, smartphone holders for using Sky apps such as 'Stellarium' or LED viewfinders for quickly targeting celestial objects.</p>\\n<p><em>Balancing weights:</em><br>Several balancing weights enable the binoculars or telescope to be precisely balanced. 2 counterweights each weighing 2.5 kg, 1.25 kg and 0.5 kg are included with the mount and can be attached to the mounting bolts on both sides at the rear end of the mount. The weights are secured to the bolts using the 2 spring tensioners included. Instead of counterweights, a filled sandbag can be attached to the existing mounting hook. This procedure reduces the transport weight for planned excursions.</p>\\n<p><em>Suitable for binoculars weighing up to 3.5 kg:</em><br>The Bresser slider mount can be used with binoculars weighing up to 3.5kg. But it is also very beneficial for much smaller binoculars too by obtain blur-free images during long-term observations. The mount is made using an optionally available binocular tripod adapter, which is attached to the mount head using a 1/4 inch photo thread screw.</p>\\n<p><em>Tripod connection:</em><br>The appropriate tripod adapter for using the optionally available Bresser stainless steel tripod ST-3 is already included in the scope of delivery of the slider mount. This converts the standardized large 3/8-inch photo tripod thread (internal thread) in the base of the slider mount into a metric M10 thread. This means that after dismantling the adapter, a stable standard photo or video tripod with 3/8-inch threaded bolts can also be used.</p>\\n<p><a>See instruction video here &gt;</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Bresser Slider binocular mount without tripod<br></li>\\n<li>Enables comfortable and fatigue-free binocular observations<br></li>\\n<li>Use for landscape and sky observation<br></li>\\n<li>Shake-free and steady images during the day and at night<br></li>\\n<li>Almost limitlessly rotatable and pivotable gimbal mount head<br></li>\\n<li>Carries binoculars and telescopes up to 3.5 kg weight<br></li>\\n<li>Various observer positions are possible: standing, sitting and lying down<br></li>\\n<li>Also a practical alternative to a photo tripod for wheelchair users<br></li>\\n<li>Dimensions when assembled using the Bresser Steel Telescope Tripod: 125 x 35 x 180 cm<br></li>\\n<li>Total weight of mounting head including accessories: 14.5kg\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Weight of mounting head: 6kg<br></li>\\n<li>Large 30 mm fluorescent bubble level in the mount base<br></li>\\n<li>Mounting holes for additional optional accessories available<br></li>\\n<li>Several balancing weights included: 2x 2.5kg, 2x 1.25kg, 2x 0.5kg<br></li>\\n<li>Adjustable slip clutches on all moving axes<br></li>\\n<li>All surfaces are high-quality painted, powder-coated or anodized<br></li>\\n<li>Precise small series production - made in the EU</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Slider mount (binoculars + tripod not included)</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Tripod adapter 3/8 inch to M10 thread</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Balance weight 2.5 kg (2 pieces)</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Balance weight 1.25 kg (2 pieces)</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Balance weight 0.5 kg (2 pieces)</em><br></li>\\n<li><em>Locking device for balancing weights (2 pieces)</em></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><span><em>FREQUENTLY BOUGHT WITH THIS ITEM</em></span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span><em>Bresser ST-3 Tripod-\\xa0<a>Click here &gt;</a></em></span></li>\\n</ul>\", 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000313-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 809.34, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/BresserBinocularSlider-MountHead_9.webp?v=1735300984', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

This versatile camera uses the state-of-the-art \"back-illuminated\" Sony IMX492 sensor.</strong></p>\\n<p>Sony specifies a sensor diagonal of 21.63mm. However, due to sensor refinement by ZWO the true diagonal is 23.2mm.</p>\\n<p>The 4.63µm pixels of the ZWO ASI294MM Pro make this camera an all-rounder with highest sensitivity for short exposure times in deep sky photography. Additionally, binning can be switched off, then the pixel size is only 2.32 µm, which increases the detail resolution - even planets can be photographed extremely well this way.</p>\\n<p><strong>Advantages and features of the ASI MC294MMPro mono camera:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>USB 3.0 for a fast download - can also be used with USB 2.0<br></li>\\n<li>DDR3 memory buffer to help improve data transfer reliability.

By cooling down the camera up to 35°C below ambient, the already low noise characteristics can be further reduced. By increasing gain (like the ISO setting of DSLR cameras), you can reduce exposure times to below 30 seconds. Effects from seeing or inaccuracies of the drive are therefore eliminated.<br></p>\\n<p>Lunar and planetary images: Extremely short exposure times (due to high sensitivity) freeze the seeing. Through the high resolution of the sensor, many details can be reproduced even at shorter focal length. Video astronomy is also possible.</p>\\n<p><em>Important: external power supply is required!</em><br>Please notice that all ZWO cameras with a cooling system need to be connected to an external 11-15V power supply to work. Even when the cooler is not being used the power supply must be used for the camera to be reliably recognized.</p>\\n<p>These cameras are not airtight, so if the camera remains on the telescope, it is exposed to moisture. The small amount of desiccant in the camera can protect the sensor and the inside of the protective glass from moisture for the duration of the exposure, but not for days on end. Moisture problems can be the result. A simple trick is to stretch a plastic bag around the focuser to which the camera is attached so that no air can get in. Silica gel is placed in a small cloth bag inside the plastic bag. This will also create a \"dry climate zone\" for the camera on the telescope. This allows you to leave the camera on the telescope for a few days for an imaging session lasting several days.</p>\\n<p>In the medium and long term, however, this is no substitute for proper storage in an airtight case with silica gel.</p>\\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Sensor: 4/3\" CMOS Sony mono IMC492LLJ - back illuminated<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 11.7 megapixels, 4144 x 2822 (2x2 Binning)<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 46.8 megapixels, 8288 x 5644 (1x1 Binning)<br></li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 4.63 µm (2x2 Binning), 2.32µm (1x1 Binning)<br></li>\\n<li>Sensor size: 19.1mm x 13.0mm - 23.2mm diagonal<br></li>\\n<li>Exposure time: m32µs to 2000s<br></li>\\n<li>Maximum frame rate at full resolution: 16.3 fps<br></li>\\n<li>QE: up to 90%<br></li>\\n<li>Full Well: approx. 66 ke-<br></li>\\n<li>Readout noise: 1.2 to 7.3e-<br></li>\\n<li>ADC: 14 bit<br></li>\\n<li>Sensor protection: Protective AR glass<br></li>\\n<li>Cooling: Peltier cooling up to 35°C below ambient<br></li>\\n<li>Software demands: USB 3.0 should be supported by operating system<br></li>\\n<li>Cache: 256 MB DDR3 cache<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope connection: T2, 2\" and 1.25\"<br></li>\\n<li>Distance T2-thread (female) to sensor: 17.5mm (6.5mm without adapter)<br></li>\\n<li>Dimensions: 78mm diameter and 73.5mm length (without 4mm male T2 thread)<br></li>\\n<li>Weight: 410g</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>ASI camera cooled, with 11mm T2 ring</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Camera bag</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>USB 3.0 cable, 2m</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Quick Guide (English)</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>T2 extension (21mm long)</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>M48 to T2 adapter (16.5mm long)</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Adapter from T2 to 1.25\" socket with filter thread</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Dust cap 1.25\"</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>M42-M48 adapter (without optical path)</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>2x USB 2.0 cable, 0.5m</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Flat adapter T2 to 1.25\" thread (without optical path)</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li><em>4x spacer ring</em></li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>Download the ASI 294MC-P Manual <a>here</a></p>\\n<p>Download the latest Camera Driver from ZWO <a>here</a></p>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000318-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 2117.05, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/ZWO-ASI-294MM-AstroCamera_6.jpg?v=1735317552', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

In addition to the modern Starvis 2 technology (back illumination), the IMX715 offers an extremely smooth image without amplifier glow (amp glow), and has extremely high resolution (1.4µm pixels).

Simply observe together in a group - without having to wait until everyone has had a turn!</p>\\n<p><em>Use as Auto-guider:</em><br>At only 126g, the camera is a very lightweight. It hardly puts any strain on the focuser. The camera of course offers the ST-4 autoguiding interface. A 2 meter long autoguiding cable is also included in the scope of delivery. Due to the extreme resolution, even small guide scopes can be used, but care must be taken to use good optics so that the advantages of the high resolution can also be utilized.</p>\\n<p><em>Anti-reflective clear glass filter protects the sensor from dust:</em><br>The clear glass filter prevents dust from penetrating the sensor. It also lets UV and infrared light through so that you can also use the camera for infrared photography. With the right choice of contrast filters, nebula filters, IR pass filters or UV/IR blocking filters, you have full control over which light falls on the sensor.</p>\\n<p><em>Air cooling - reduces the sensor temperature:</em><br>As with all cameras, the sensor heats up during recording. The PCS dissipates the heat from the sensor via a heat conduction pad. The sensor temperature is therefore reduced by up to 15 degrees Celsius compared to cameras without PCS.</p>\\n<p><em>Very high sensitivity for short exposure times:</em><br>One advantage of the back-illuminated CMOS sensor is the reduced readout noise and improved sensitivity. In particular, Sony uses STARVIS-2 technology with the IMX662 sensor, which ensures excellent visibility in low light. You can achieve a very high light yield in astrophotography and realize high image quality not only in visible light, but also in the near infrared range (to reduce seeing). In addition, the low readout noise and the high full-well capacity ensure a wider dynamic range.<br>The low noise and anti-amp glow circuit make this camera very interesting for capturing small deep-sky objects too.</p>\\n<p><em>The HCG mode:</em><br>The camera has a built-in HCG mode that can effectively reduce the readout noise at high gain while maintaining the same wide dynamic range you would expect at low gain. When the gain is 150, the HCG mode turns on automatically. This results in the readout noise being below 1.4 e-, while the dynamic range can still reach almost 12.5 f-stops.</p>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Sensor: Sony 1/2.8\" CMOS IMX715 Color Sensor<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 3864 x 2192 pixels, 8.46 megapixels<br></li>\\n<li>Pixel size: 1.45µm<br></li>\\n<li>Sensor size: 5.6mm x 3.2mm<br></li>\\n<li>Diagonal: 6.45mm (1/2.8\")<br></li>\\n<li>Frame rate: up to 45.1 FPS at 10 bit<br></li>\\n<li>Exposure time: from 32µs - 2000 s<br></li>\\n<li>ROI: Supported<br></li>\\n<li>ST4 autoguider port: Yes<br></li>\\n<li>Distance from T2 thread to sensor: 12.5mm<br></li>\\n<li>Shutter type: Rolling shutter<br></li>\\n<li>Protection window: AR coated, full IR transmission<br></li>\\n<li>Connection: USB3.0/USB2.0<br></li>\\n<li>QE: ~80 %<br></li>\\n<li>Full well: 6.029 ke-<br></li>\\n<li>Anti-ampglow circuit: Yes<br></li>\\n<li>Readout noise: 6.9 e- to 0.8 e-<br></li>\\n<li>Bit resolution: 12 bit ADC<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope connection: M42 x 0.75 / 2\" / 1.25\" (via adapter)<br></li>\\n<li>Tripod thread: 1/4\" on the rear side<br></li>\\n<li>Dimensions: D 62mm x 37.1mm (without lens)<br></li>\\n<li>Operating temperature: -5 °C to +50 °C<br></li>\\n<li>System requirements: USB 3.0 should be supported by the operating system - from Windows 8, Mac OS X 10.8, Linux Kernel 2.6.31 (from Ubuntu 16.04)<br></li>\\n<li>Weight: 126g</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>ASI camera</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Adapter T2 (M42 x 0.75) on 1.25\"</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>1.25\" cover</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Adapter T2 to CS mount (mounted)</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Wide field lens (mounted)</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>USB 3.0 cable</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>ST4 cable</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li><em>Quick Start Guide</em></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>Software Download:</strong><br>Drivers and programs for this camera can be downloaded from the following link - <a>HERE</a></p>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000319-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 302.88, 'Variant Price': 151.44, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/ZWO-ASI175MC-Astrocamera_5.jpg?v=1735318950', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

Its not only suitable for photographing planets, but also for deep-sky objects such as galaxies, nebulae and star clusters. </strong></p>\\n<p>Dedicated ToupSky Astro Imaging software supports video preview, video recording, video processing, image capture and processing, dark field correction and raw data output. Its easy to use, but with professional results.</p>\\n<p>One of the main features of the new backlit SONY IMX290 CMOS sensor is its high light sensitivity, which makes it possible to detect deep-sky objects without active cooling. SONY has increased the quantum efficiency at 533nm wavelength up to 77%, which is much better than other CMOS sensors have been able to achieve in the past.</p>\\n<p>Connect this camera to a guidescope and attach the camera\\'s built-in ST-4 port, directly to your telescope\\'s equatorial mount guide port and you can also use this camera for autoguiding - using many popular audioguiding programs (such as PHD and more). Autoguiding enables you to take accurate pictures with long exposure times of several minutes. Thanks to the extra light-sensitive camera, you now always have a suitable guide star to hand, even using short exposure times. An ST-4 protocol connection cable is also included.</p>\\n<p>You can use this camera with all guiding telescopes, or off-axis guiders that accept a 1.25\" tube, 1.25\" filter thread (M28.5x0.6) or C-mount adapter thread (1 \"x1 /32\").</p>\\n<p><em>Important Note:</em></p>\\n<p>This is not a stand-alone camera.

Its very easy to operate via ASCOM drivers or by using standalone software which will make your life much easier by allowing you to automatically adjust your exact camera field of view with precision.</strong></p>\\n<p>Operating the Falcon Rotator V2 is a seamless experience, thanks to its compatibility with classic ASCOM, native ASCOM Alpaca drivers and the Unity Platform software. This user-friendly design simplifies the process of automatically and precisely orienting your camera field, making your astrophotography endeavors significantly more convenient and efficient.</p>\\n<p><em>M68 threads on both sides and low profile:</em><br>Both sides of the rotator are M68 threaded, so it is possible to use large sensors without vignetting. The thickness of the rotator is just 15.5mm and the weight only 700g, but it can handle a 6kg payload.</p>\\n<p><em>Adapters for both sides:</em><br>There are adapters for many common threads available which can be purchased separately.</p>\\n<p><em>Precise rotation:</em><br>A powerful geared / low backlash stepper motor ensures that the rotator will lock to the designated degree angle. High quality mechanical components inside the focuser prevent flexure at any point during a full circle rotation.</p>\\n<p><em>High rated load:</em><br>Falcon Rotator V2 has been tested at 6Kg (13lbs) of imaging setup. The mechanical design allows it to custom tighten internal bearing so it can easily handle higher payloads with almost zero flexure.</p>\\n<p><em>One Cable Operation:</em><br>The rotator can be connected with a USB-C cable for both power and data, reducing complexity in your telescope setup. Additionally, it´s Wi-Fi enabled, allowing you to control your field rotation remotely from your mobile phone.</p>\\n<p><em>Field De-Rotation support for Alt/Az mounts:</em><br>The rotator has the mechanical precision to achieve field de-rotation. The supplied Unity Platform calculates Rate of Rotation (RoR) based on the site latitude, target altitude and azimuth position. By fine-tuning the micro-step drive control of the motor, derotation can achieve a resolution as precise as 5 arc-seconds.</p>\\n<p><em>ASCOM &amp; INDI support:</em><br>The rotator is fully ASCOM 6 supported.

With these telescopes you do not have to settle for any compromises. UNC stands for Universal Newtonian telescope with Carbon tube. Each UNC Newtonian is individually manufactured for you in Germany. </strong></p>\\n<p><strong>These Telescopes are specially made to order.</strong></p>\\n<p>The 10\" f/4 UNC Newtonian is a versatile and relatively compact telescope for portable and stationary use. The high speed of f/4 makes the Newtonian the ideal telescope for astrophotography. We recommend an EQ6 or CGEM mount, which comfortably holds a Newtonian of this size with good stability when used for astrophotography.</p>\\n<p>Checkout some examples of photos taken with this Telescope on <a>Astrobin here</a> &gt;</p>\\n<p><em>The advantages of the TS UNC Newtonian telescope:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>High-quality carbon tube made in Germany with maximum stability - customized manufacturing to suit your needs.<br></li>\\n<li>Optimized focus position as desired and therefore also best possible illumination<br>Primary mirror cell and secondary mirror cell has been further improved by Teleskop-Service in Germany<br></li>\\n<li>Easy collimation of primary and secondary mirror - by hand, without tools<br></li>\\n<li>The edge of the secondary mirror is blackened<br></li>\\n<li>TS Rack and Pinion focuser with M54 x 0.75 intermediate thread, also suitable for heavy cameras<br></li>\\n<li>The secondary is attached to the secondary mirror mount with the correct offset before its shipped to you.<br></li>\\n<li>94% reflectivity on primary mirror and secondary mirror for a brighter image<br></li>\\n<li>Diffraction limited primary mirror - each individual telescope is tested on an optical bench before shipment</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Every UNC Newtonian is darkened inside:</em><br>The tube inner side of the UNC Newtonian telescopes is darkened which prevents reflections and provides better contrast. The TS \"Black\" anti-reflective paint or a velour film is used. The result is a matte black tube interior. Velour film and the TS \"Black\" have a similar effect and darken better than the commonly used chalkboard paint.</p>\\n<p><em>The Carbon Tube - finest precision work:</em><br>The carbon tube is extra solid and completely reinforced, and not only around the focuser which makes the tube much stiffer. The openings for the secondary spider vanes are precisely fitted with turned mating parts, to ensure that the secondary spider vanes are correct and the telescope produces perfect spikes right from the start.</p>\\n<p><em>Focus position optimized for astrophotography:</em><br>The focus point is 135mm above the tube. This allows you to use different focusers and still have a comfortable working distance. With the standard focuser you even get 80mm working distance, which even allows the use of focal reducers or a binoviewer with moderate glass path compensation. For standard correctors like the Baader MPCC or the TS-Optics MAXFIELD corrector we recommend the 20mm spacer, which goes between the focuser. This gives you 60mm backfocus. Note: For visual observations you need a 2\" extension tube.</p>\\n<p><em>The 2\" TS UNCN2-G2 focuser:</em><br>A core component of the TS UNC-Newtons is the modern TS UNCN2-G2 focuser. The focuser builds up only 58mm from the tube edge and still carries heavy cameras and accessories without tilting. This type of focuser is also far superior to conventional Crayford focusers.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Focuser Features:</strong><br></li>\\n<li>High stiffness with extremely short length<br></li>\\n<li>Precise 1:10 dual-speed gear - for perfectly focused Astrophotographs<br></li>\\n<li>The adjustment is decoupled from the ball bearing - a clear advantage over Crayford focusers<br></li>\\n<li>Can be adapted with motorized focusers<br></li>\\n<li>The ball bearings are adjustable, so the focuser tension can be adjusted perfectly - but its delivered with the focuser already optimally adjusted.<br></li>\\n<li>Accessories can be screwed on - the 2\" receptacle can be unscrewed, providing you with an M54 x 0.75 female thread.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>More information about the focuser UNCN2-G2:</em></p>\\n<p><em>Parabolic primary mirror:</em><br>Newtonian primary mirrors made of fused silica are free of strain and provide an image that is usually even much better than diffraction limited. The surface is coated with an enhanced 94% reflection layer and a protective quartz layer. The primary mirror has a central marking as an adjustment aid.</p>\\n<p><em>Primary mirror fan for faster cool-down:</em><br>A fan accelerates the cooling down to ambient temperature. As long as a mirror has not cooled down properly, it generates warm air currents that degrade the image - regardless of which mirror substrate is used. This effect only stops once the mirror has cooled down.</p>\\n<p>Every TS Carbon Newtonian is tested on an optical bench before shipping:<br>After assembly, each UNC Newtonian is subjected to an optical test in the workshop before shipping. This ensures that the telescope will adapt perfectly with your accessories and also delivers the optical performance you expect.</p>\\n<p>Before shipping, the primary mirror with the cell is removed from the tube and packed separately. This is done to ensure a safer shipment and avoid unnecessary transport damages.</p>\\n<p><span><strong>Choose your focus positions and secondary mirror diameter:</strong></span></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<span><strong>Focus position No. 1</strong></span>: Set 60mm above the 2\" receptacle has proven to be very versatile. It is the standard position. Nevertheless, we can also offer you individual focus positions and other secondary mirror sizes at no extra charge:<br></li>\\n<li>\\n<span><strong>Focus position No. 2</strong></span>: Set 30mm above the 2\" receptacle - optimal for visual observation or for correctors with focal length extension, such as the PARACORR from TeleVue. The secondary mirror will be slightly smaller.<br></li>\\n<li>\\n<span><strong>Focus position No. 3</strong></span>: Set 90mm above the 2\" receptacle - this allows you to use the TS2KORRR 0.73x Reducer/Corrector and improve the telescope speed. The combination is then designed for cameras up to APS-C format.

With these telescopes you do not have to settle for any compromises. UNC stands for Universal Newtonian telescope with Carbon tube. Each UNC Newtonian is individually manufactured for you in Germany. </strong></p>\\n<p><strong>These Telescopes are specially made to order.</strong></p>\\n<p>The 10\" f/4 UNC Newtonian is a versatile and relatively compact telescope for portable and stationary use. The high speed of f/4 makes the Newtonian the ideal telescope for astrophotography. We recommend an EQ6 or CGEM mount, which comfortably holds a Newtonian of this size with good stability when used for astrophotography.</p>\\n<p>Checkout some examples of photos taken with this Telescope on <a>Astrobin here</a> &gt;</p>\\n<p><em>The advantages of the TS UNC Newtonian telescope:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>High-quality carbon tube made in Germany with maximum stability - customized manufacturing to suit your needs.<br></li>\\n<li>Optimized focus position as desired and therefore also best possible illumination<br>Primary mirror cell and secondary mirror cell has been further improved by Teleskop-Service in Germany<br></li>\\n<li>Easy collimation of primary and secondary mirror - by hand, without tools<br></li>\\n<li>The edge of the secondary mirror is blackened<br></li>\\n<li>TS Rack and Pinion focuser with M54 x 0.75 intermediate thread, also suitable for heavy cameras<br></li>\\n<li>The secondary is attached to the secondary mirror mount with the correct offset before its shipped to you.<br></li>\\n<li>94% reflectivity on primary mirror and secondary mirror for a brighter image<br></li>\\n<li>Diffraction limited primary mirror - each individual telescope is tested on an optical bench before shipment</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Every UNC Newtonian is darkened inside:</em><br>The tube inner side of the UNC Newtonian telescopes is darkened which prevents reflections and provides better contrast. The TS \"Black\" anti-reflective paint or a velour film is used. The result is a matte black tube interior. Velour film and the TS \"Black\" have a similar effect and darken better than the commonly used chalkboard paint.</p>\\n<p><em>The Carbon Tube - finest precision work:</em><br>The carbon tube is extra solid and completely reinforced, and not only around the focuser which makes the tube much stiffer. The openings for the secondary spider vanes are precisely fitted with turned mating parts, to ensure that the secondary spider vanes are correct and the telescope produces perfect spikes right from the start.</p>\\n<p><em>Focus position optimized for astrophotography:</em><br>The focus point is 135mm above the tube. This allows you to use different focusers and still have a comfortable working distance. With the standard focuser you even get 80mm working distance, which even allows the use of focal reducers or a binoviewer with moderate glass path compensation. For standard correctors like the Baader MPCC or the TS-Optics MAXFIELD corrector we recommend the 20mm spacer, which goes between the focuser. This gives you 60mm backfocus. Note: For visual observations you need a 2\" extension tube.</p>\\n<p><em>The 2\" TS UNCN2-G2 focuser:</em><br>A core component of the TS UNC-Newtons is the modern TS UNCN2-G2 focuser. The focuser builds up only 58mm from the tube edge and still carries heavy cameras and accessories without tilting. This type of focuser is also far superior to conventional Crayford focusers.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Focuser Features:</strong><br></li>\\n<li>High stiffness with extremely short length<br></li>\\n<li>Precise 1:10 dual-speed gear - for perfectly focused Astrophotographs<br></li>\\n<li>The adjustment is decoupled from the ball bearing - a clear advantage over Crayford focusers<br></li>\\n<li>Can be adapted with motorized focusers<br></li>\\n<li>The ball bearings are adjustable, so the focuser tension can be adjusted perfectly - but its delivered with the focuser already optimally adjusted.<br></li>\\n<li>Accessories can be screwed on - the 2\" receptacle can be unscrewed, providing you with an M54 x 0.75 female thread.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>More information about the focuser UNCN2-G2:</em></p>\\n<p><em>Parabolic primary mirror:</em><br>Newtonian primary mirrors made of fused silica are free of strain and provide an image that is usually even much better than diffraction limited. The surface is coated with an enhanced 94% reflection layer and a protective quartz layer. The primary mirror has a central marking as an adjustment aid.</p>\\n<p><em>Primary mirror fan for faster cool-down:</em><br>A fan accelerates the cooling down to ambient temperature. As long as a mirror has not cooled down properly, it generates warm air currents that degrade the image - regardless of which mirror substrate is used. This effect only stops once the mirror has cooled down.</p>\\n<p>Every TS Carbon Newtonian is tested on an optical bench before shipping:<br>After assembly, each UNC Newtonian is subjected to an optical test in the workshop before shipping. This ensures that the telescope will adapt perfectly with your accessories and also delivers the optical performance you expect.</p>\\n<p>Before shipping, the primary mirror with the cell is removed from the tube and packed separately. This is done to ensure a safer shipment and avoid unnecessary transport damages.</p>\\n<p><span><strong>Choose your focus positions and secondary mirror diameter:</strong></span></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<span><strong>Focus Position No.1</strong></span> - Astrophotography with normal coma correctors - 65mm distance from the 2\" connection of the focuser (Standard Version) This version is perfect for nearly all 2\" Newtonian coma correctors.

Having all your power and data needs centralised, you minimise cables which can disturb the movements of the mount, only the main power cord and one USB data cord are attached to the Ultimate Powerbox which branches off to power all other devices.</p>\\n<p><em>6 x 12V DC Power outlets for your equipment:</em><br>Six powerful smart MOSFET transistors provide \"electric power\" to your equipment. Sophisticated short circuit and overload per port protections cut the power and report the incident into the software. Every MOSFET is capable of providing up to 6 amps of current.</p>\\n<p><em>Built-in Power Sensors:</em><br>A precise voltmeter and an ammeter (can measure up to 20A) measure and display in real-time the power input. If the input is more than 14.5V the power is instantly cut off to protect your equipment.</p>\\n<p><em>Individual Current Meter per 12V smart output:</em><br>Each smart 12 V output has an internal and independent digital current meter. You can view each port´s power consumption in the software.</p>\\n<p>Additional Power Outputs and Sensors:<br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>2 x Always ON 12V outputs increase the total 12V outputs to 10.<br></li>\\n<li>1 x Adjustable Voltage Step Down output can be regulated from 3V to 12V and provide up to 3 amps of power.<br></li>\\n<li>1 x Adjustable Voltage Step Up output can be regulated from 12V to 24V and provide up to 4 amps of power.<br></li>\\n<li>3 x Dew Heater outputs - the three pulse width modulation (PWM) outlets are capable of providing power to your \"thirsty\" dew heaters / flatpanels or telescope fans. Eliminate the moisture that is fuzzing your equipment and destroying your clear nights. These outlets can be remotely tuned from your laptop using the supplied software.<br></li>\\n<li>1 x Switch Relay can pass 250V / 10A and used to switch ON/OFF any 3rd party equipment.<br></li>\\n<li>A built-in ambient temperature and relative humidity sensor provides frequently readouts of the environmental conditions and automatically adjusts the heat intensity of your dew heater strips.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Embedded Stepper Motor Controller:</em><br>A silent and low vibrating stepper motor controller will precisely move your drawtube of your focuser. The controller drives a Pegasus Motor Focus Kit or almost any other stepper motor in the market (Unipolar or Bipolar) e.g. Rigel, Robofocus, Moonlight, Starlight motors. Backlash compensation is already implemented in the firmware and can be enabled, tuned and disabled from the software. A fully ASCOM6 compliant focuser driver is already available.</p>\\n<p><em>Supported Stepper Motors:<br></em>Make sure you have the correct cable for your motor.

It has been developed to track the stars and to compensate for the movement of the earth and is extremely simple and compact designed for use in every location on earth.</strong></p>\\n<p>If you have ever viewed a romantic, starry sky, you will surely have felt the desire to capture it on a camera but if you have tried to do this, you will know that it’s really not all that easy. This is because you need to have multiple exposures of several minutes if you want to photograph the stars. As our earth is always turning on its axis, the stars keep moving as time passes and as a result, in the photo become they long streaks of light on photographs. Today’s digital technology gives us the option of obtaining shorter exposure times by increasing the sensitivity of the sensor, but, unfortunately, this dramatically increases picture noise and the picture becomes very noisy and harsh. This makes it extremely difficult to take beautiful images of the night sky. For this reason, the Vixen company has developed the Polarie Star Tracker, which eliminates the problem of star migration. When you attach your camera to the Polarie, the device will track in the opposite direction of the earth’s rotation and this allows for sharp, point-like images of the starry sky even when using very long exposure times.</p>\\n<p>The multi-functional mode dial is adjustable for sky- and landscape-, moon-, sun- and star-tracking. Also included: USB connection for external power supply and a built-in compass for quick orientation.

The Nano Tracker is recommended for all DSLR cameras and system cameras with a wide-angle or light telephoto lenses up to 2kg in weight.</strong></p>\\n<p><em>Nano Tracker - Incredibly detailed Milkyway Photography:</em><br>With Nano Tracker you can take very impressive long exposure photos of the beautiful night sky. All you need is a camera and a photo tripod. The Nano Tracker ensures accurate tracking and is not only intended for experienced astrophotographers who like to be able to shoot on the go but because it so simple to use, its also ideal for beginners in astrophotography.</p>\\n<p><em>The Nano Tracker compensates for the Earth´s rotation:</em><br>Because the Earth rotates on its own axis, all celestial objects seem to move from east to west i the sky. This means that any kind of long exposure of the night sky would result in the starts becoming long streaks of light instead of pinpoint stars. The Nano Tracker compensates for this movement meaning you can do much longer exposures and the stars appear pinpoint and much brighter in the photo. For an exact alignment in the northern hemisphere, simply align it with the Pole Star and the NanoTracker will be ready to go.</p>\\n<p><em>Tip: With a compass and your smartphone´s tilt sensor, you can also set up the NanoTracker perfectly in both the northern and southern hemispheres.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Time lapse and video animation made easy:</em><br>With the NanoTracker you can also create beautiful time-lapse series shots and movies, for example of landscapes with the changing shadows and clouds or stunning time lapse movies of the Milkyway. At night such videos impressively show the movement of the stars - especially when they are recorded at half sidereal speed.</p>\\n<p>This is what you need for successful operation:<br>The NanoTracker consists of the compact motor unit and the manual control box, which also contains the battery compartment. The motor unit is placed between the photo tripod with video pointer/ball head and a second ball head, which are not included. The manual control box contains the controls where you can set the desired speed. All you need other than the Nano Tracker is a good tripod with a ball or tilt head, and of course a camera. The best choice is a DSLR camera or system camera with a fast wide-angle lens and a programmable remote shutter release. As a photo tripod you can use any stable tripod.</p>\\n<p>You will also need three AA batteries, which are not included. At 20°C a set of batteries can last up to 5 hours, however as with all batteries, at low temperatures this time reduces. The battery compartment is integrated in the hand controller and is easily accessible so that you can change the batteries on frosty nights without having to adjust the tripod.</p>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Speed Settings: 1x, 0.5x, lunar, solar and max. 50x star speed<br></li>\\n<li>Area of application: Worldwide - Northern/Southern hemisphere switchable<br></li>\\n<li>Motor: Stepper motor<br></li>\\n<li>Mechanics: Steel-brass worm wheel drive 50 teeth<br></li>\\n<li>Bearing: 2 ball bearings<br></li>\\n<li>Connection tripod side: 1/4\" female thread<br></li>\\n<li>Connection camera side: 1/4\" male thread<br></li>\\n<li>Max Payload: 2kg<br></li>\\n<li>Power supply: 3x AA batteries (LR6) or Mini USB<br></li>\\n<li>Dimensions: Tracker 60 x 98 x 44mm, hand controller 50 x 105 x 22mm (without cable)<br></li>\\n<li>Weight: Tracker 350 grams, hand controller 80 grams</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Star Tracking unit</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li><em>Hand controller (Batteries not included)</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000341-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 302.88, 'Variant Price': 151.44, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/NanotrackerStarTracker_6.jpg?v=1743788033', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

They also tend to capture stray light, which reduces the contrast of the target.</p>\\n<p>As many Astronomers and Astrophotographers have experienced, on clear nights dew is often a real problem and if it forms on your lens it can render your nights observing session over. After only a very short time, the optics can start fogging, making viewing or photography impossible. These Celestron Dew Protection Heater Rings are the ideal solution for preventing this problem.</p>\\n<p>The dew-protection heater rings are available in various sizes depending on your telescope OTA size and they replace the retaining ring on your existing Celestron Telescope. Installation is quick and easy <a>(Follow instructions in the manual here)</a>.</p>\\n<p><em>How does it work?</em><br>The dew-protection heater ring replaces the plastic retaining ring on your telescope's Schmidt plate and provides efficient heating of the front lens. The ring is made of lightweight, durable aluminum and its rigid frame supports both the cabling and the telescope's Schmidt plate. Unlike other heating bands or strips, which inefficiently heat the entire OTA cell to warm the glass, the Celestron dew-protection heater ring transfers heat directly to the Schmidt plate, providing the most efficient heat transfer to prevent dew formation.</p>\\n<p>Simply connect the ring to an external 12V DC Dew Heater power source for a consistent, continuous heat supply that prevents dew formation, even in high humidity. The dew-proof heating ring features two storage clips to safely store the power and thermistor connectors when not in use, and a dust cover for the telescope.</p>\\n<p>The dew-proof heater ring also comes with a cable management clip that can be attached to the front of the OTA. This allows you to secure the power and thermistor jack-plugs for strain relief and to neatly route the connecting cables.</p>\\n<p>The ring also includes an extension cable that allows it to be connected directly to one of the controller's heater outputs or to the heater output of another controller. (Note: The heated ring also has an integrated temperature probe (thermistor) however this is only compatible with Celestron's Smart Power and Dew Control box) We also recommend using a dew cap. While not required, it reduces the energy required by the dew heater ring to keep the optics clear.</p>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Dew protection heating ring</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Cable management clip</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Extension cable for the power socket</em><br></li>\\n<li><em>Paper cover to protect the Schmidt plate during assembly</em></li>\\n</ol>\", 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000346-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 50.59, 'Variant Price': 25.3, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Celestron-Dew-Heater-Rings_3.webp?v=1752322210', 'Image Position': '1', 'Option1 Name': 'Choose Telescope Size', 'Option1 Value': '5\" Schmidt Cassegrain'}\n",

The StarSense camera eye takes three pictures of the sky after the telescope is switched on. This takes about three minutes. After that, the device knows where in the sky which stars, planets, galaxies, and gas nebulae are located and shows them to you at the touch of a button! It even suggests the most beautiful objects in the sky. You really don't need any prior experience to become an amateur astronomer on your first night with this fantastic new technology. In fact, 40,000 celestial objects are stored in its database!</p>\\n<p>Even experienced amateur astronomers will appreciate the affordable StarSense module. StarSense replaces expensive software and enables excellent horizon-to-horizon positioning accuracy thanks to any number of calibration stars. And of course, you can use the short time the telescope automatically completes the alignment procedure to prepare for the night.</p>\\n<p>StarSense for Celestron is compatible with all current computerized Celestron telescopes, as well as many of the older models too.</p>\\n<p><strong>StarSense on Azimuthal telescopes:</strong><br>The StarSense module can fully demonstrate its capabilities on alt-azimuth telescopes – including motorized Dobsonians. No north alignment is required, you simply need to set up the device under a clear, dark sky with an unobstructed view of the surrounding sky. At least three-quarters of the sky should allow a clear view of the starry sky. Then simply enter the date, time, and location as usual. For devices with built-in GPS or the optional SkySync GPS receiver, this is unnecessary as the GPS module will detect this information automatically.</p>\\n<p>The StarSense camera then scans the sky, and after about three minutes, it has enough data to create a model of the sky. Then all you have to do is select the objects you want to observe from the handheld controller's extensive database. If you were caught off guard by good weather and didn't have time to prepare for the night of observation, that's no problem either as The TOUR function suggests the most beautiful objects currently visible in the night sky at your present location.</p>\\n<p><strong>StarSense on Equatorial telescopes:</strong><br>The StarSense module can also be used on equatorially mounted telescopes (such as the Celestron Advanced VX, CGEM, CGEM DX, CGE Pro, or even certain SkyWatcher SynScan mounts such as the EQ6, EQ8, AZ-EQ5, and AZ-EQ6).</p>\\n<p>However, if you're using the mount while on the move, you'll still need to align it north – after all, the tracking axis must be parallel to the Earth's axis. The StarSense module can help with this too: If you've only roughly aligned the mount north (i.e., you've placed the telescope in its starting position and can see Polaris in the finderscope) and switch on the StarSense module, the telescope will search for the reference stars. If you use more than two reference stars, you can increase the GOTO accuracy for visual use.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>You can then call up the All Star Polar Alignment, familiar and proven from the Celestron NexStar controller, to align the mount to another reference star. Since you have to turn the mount's adjustment screws for this, the StarsSense module can only help here.

The telescope is perfect for visual observations and, with an optional polar wedge and an astro camera, also enables professional astrophotography.</strong></p>\\n<p>As the largest instrument in this series, the CPC Deluxe 1100 HD telescope gathers the most light out of all the range - almost 90% more than the 8\" model and still over 40% more than the 9.25\" model. The CPC Deluxe features the newly redesigned fork mount and modern EdgeHD optics.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to sophisticated software features such as the hibernate function, the telescope remembers its position from one night to the next - assuming it is not moved during that time, of course. This makes it ideal for permanent installation in an observatory. Yet it is compact enough to be easily transported to an observing site.</p>\\n<p>The conveniently positioned carrying handles and an instrument weight of just under 30kg make it easy to set up in your own garden or transport to your favorite observing spot.</p>\\n<p><strong>New Optical Design:</strong><br>EdgeHD (Edge High Definition) optics combine the compact design of a Schmidt-Cassegrain with significantly improved image quality at the edge of the image. This optical system not only offers astrograph characteristics, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view. This not only corrects off-axis coma—as with other so-called \"coma-free\" optical designs available on the market—but also field curvature! All EdgeHD telescopes deliver a large, flat field of view, enabling sharp star images even at the edge of large CCD sensors.</p>\\n<p><strong>Built-in GPS:</strong><br>The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature a built-in GPS sensor that automatically receives the date, time, and your exact location from the GPS satellites. This eliminates the need to manually enter this data.</p>\\n<p><strong>SkyAlign:</strong><br>This is Celestron\\'s incredibly easy alignment process for perfect GoTo positioning. The telescope no longer requires a defined home position: Simply align three bright stars (planets and the moon are also possible) one after the other in the telescope\\'s field of view, and voilà! Your CPC telescope is ready for automatic GoTo positioning to any object from the hand control\\'s database.</p>\\n<p>SkyAlign calculates your telescope\\'s alignment based on the trajectories of the three stars and the corresponding angles. SkyAlign retrieves the other required data (date, time, and location coordinates) via the integrated 16-channel GPS receiver.</p>\\n<p>\" SkyAlign \" only works in azimuthal mode, i.e., when the telescope is operated directly on the tripod without a polar wedge. Celestron also offers several new and simplified alignment methods for equatorial operation in the CPC series.</p>\\n<p><strong>Comprehensive Database:</strong><br>The CPC telescope database contains over 40,000 celestial objects, including the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as galaxies and nebulae from the NGC catalog and planets. You can narrow down your search to simplify your search in this comprehensive database and hide objects that are currently below the horizon.</p>\\n<p>The \"Identify\" function tells you what you\\'re currently seeing in the telescope, and it also lets you easily explore the sky. Simply point the telescope at any area of the sky and, for example, display the nearest Messier objects—the telescope will move to them for you. You can do this in different areas of the sky and with different objects!</p>\\n<p>With \"Solar Sys Align\" you can align the telescope using the sun or moon even during the day to observe the planets or the brightest stars in the daytime sky.</p>\\n<p>Hyperstar Compatible: All EdgeHD tubes allow you to remove and replace the secondary mirror. The result: With the optional HyperStar optics, your standard Celestron EdgeHD telescope becomes a digital Schmidt Design for your CCD or DSLR camera for primary focus photography.</p>\\n<p><strong>Innovative features of the Mount:</strong></p>\\n<p>Design - For the CPC Deluxe HD telescopes, Celestron has redesigned the drive mechanism. It features a 15 cm (6 inch) brass gear with 180 teeth and a stainless steel worm gear, as well as a unique steel and nylon ball bearing design for even smoother tracking for long-exposure deep-sky imaging.</p>\\n<p>Innovation - The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature the innovative All-Star™ Polar Alignment . When used with the optional polar wedge, you can align the telescope to any bright star in equatorial mode—no need to look at Polaris! Astrophotographers will also appreciate the Permanent Periodic Error Correction (PEC) feature. You can record the helical error so it\\'s automatically corrected in the future.</p>\\n<p>Power Management - The redesigned electronics supply the motors with constantly regulated voltage, allowing them to move the telescope even when it\\'s not fully balanced. This maintains smooth operation and high GoTo accuracy.</p>\\n<p>Performance - You can track objects far beyond the meridian, allowing you to observe the most interesting part of the sky without interruption.<br>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</p>\\n<p><strong>Mount Spec:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Alignment methods: SkyAlign, Auto Two-Star Alignment, Two-star Align,</li>\\n<li>SolarSystem Align, EQ North, EQ South, One-Star Align<br></li>\\n<li>Database: Over 40,000+ objects, 100 custom objects<br></li>\\n<li>Mount control: Computer-controlled (GOTO)<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking speeds: Sidereal, solar and lunar<br></li>\\n<li>Tracking modes: Azimuthal, EQ-North, EQ-South<br></li>\\n<li>Screw defect control (PPEC): PEC, permanently programmable<br></li>\\n<li>Panning speed: Nine speeds, maximum 3°/second<br></li>\\n<li>Type: Azimuthal double fork<br></li>\\n<li>GPS: Built in - 16 channels<br></li>\\n<li>Hand Control Box - Yes<br></li>\\n<li>Power Consumption: 12V DC, 2.5A</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Resolution (DAWES): 0.41 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution (RAYLEIGH): 0.50 arcseconds<br></li>\\n<li>Focal length: 2800mm (110 in)<br></li>\\n<li>F/Ratio: f/10<br></li>\\n<li>Telescopic Aperture: 280mm (11\")<br></li>\\n<li>secondary mirror obstruction: 9.5cm<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction relative to diameter: 34.00%<br></li>\\n<li>Secondary mirror obstruction relative to the surface: 11.60%<br></li>\\n<li>field of vision: 0.67°<br></li>\\n<li>Highest useful magnification: 661x<br></li>\\n<li>Light gathering capacity (to the human eye): 1593x naked eye<br></li>\\n<li>Lowest useful magnification: 40x<br></li>\\n<li>Optical design: EdgeHD<br></li>\\n<li>Optical coating: Starbright XLT (Fully multi-coated)<br></li>\\n<li>Focuser size (inches): 3.3\" + 2\" SC thread, 1.25\"<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope series: CPC Deluxe HD<br></li>\\n<li>Tube weight: 30 kg (telescope and mount, without tripod)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Focal length eyepiece: 23mm</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Incl. accessories: 11\" Schmidt-Cassegrain in computer-controlled CPC double fork mount, height-adjustable tripod, storage plate, 8x50 finder.</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Viewfinder: 8x50 finder with quick coupling.</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Zenith prism: 1.25\".</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li><em>Accessory tray: Tripod spreader/eyepiece holder.</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000356-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 6431.17, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Celestron-CPC-1100-Deluxe_1.webp?v=1752494784', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

The telescope is perfect for visual observations and, with an optional polar wedge and an astro camera, also enables professional astrophotography.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>New Optical Design:</strong><br>EdgeHD (Edge High Definition) optics combine the compact design of a Schmidt-Cassegrain with significantly improved image quality at the edge of the image. This optical system not only offers astrograph characteristics, but also produces completely undistorted, sharp images right up to the edge of the large visual and photographic field of view. This not only corrects off-axis coma—as with other so-called \"coma-free\" optical designs available on the market—but also field curvature! All EdgeHD telescopes deliver a large, flat field of view, enabling sharp star images even at the edge of large CCD sensors.</p>\\n<p><strong>Built-in GPS:</strong><br>The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature a built-in GPS sensor that automatically receives the date, time, and your exact location from the GPS satellites. This eliminates the need to manually enter this data.</p>\\n<p><strong>SkyAlign:</strong><br>This is Celestron\\'s incredibly easy alignment process for perfect GoTo positioning. The telescope no longer requires a defined home position: Simply align three bright stars (planets and the moon are also possible) one after the other in the telescope\\'s field of view, and voilà! Your CPC telescope is ready for automatic GoTo positioning to any object from the hand control\\'s database.</p>\\n<p>SkyAlign calculates your telescope\\'s alignment based on the trajectories of the three stars and the corresponding angles. SkyAlign retrieves the other required data (date, time, and location coordinates) via the integrated 16-channel GPS receiver.</p>\\n<p>\" SkyAlign \" only works in azimuthal mode, i.e., when the telescope is operated directly on the tripod without a polar wedge. Celestron also offers several new and simplified alignment methods for equatorial operation in the CPC series.</p>\\n<p><strong>Comprehensive Database:</strong><br>The CPC telescope database contains over 40,000 celestial objects, including the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as galaxies and nebulae from the NGC catalog and planets. You can narrow down your search to simplify your search in this comprehensive database and hide objects that are currently below the horizon.</p>\\n<p>The \"Identify\" function tells you what you\\'re currently seeing in the telescope, and it also lets you easily explore the sky. Simply point the telescope at any area of the sky and, for example, display the nearest Messier objects—the telescope will move to them for you. You can do this in different areas of the sky and with different objects!</p>\\n<p>With \"Solar Sys Align\" you can align the telescope using the sun or moon even during the day to observe the planets or the brightest stars in the daytime sky.</p>\\n<p>Hyperstar Compatible: All EdgeHD tubes allow you to remove and replace the secondary mirror. The result: With the optional HyperStar optics, your standard Celestron EdgeHD telescope becomes a digital Schmidt Design for your CCD or DSLR camera for primary focus photography.</p>\\n<p><strong>Innovative features of the Mount:</strong></p>\\n<p>Design - For the CPC Deluxe HD telescopes, Celestron has redesigned the drive mechanism. It features a 15 cm (6 inch) brass gear with 180 teeth and a stainless steel worm gear, as well as a unique steel and nylon ball bearing design for even smoother tracking for long-exposure deep-sky imaging.</p>\\n<p>Innovation - The CPC Deluxe HD telescopes feature the innovative All-Star™ Polar Alignment . When used with the optional polar wedge, you can align the telescope to any bright star in equatorial mode—no need to look at Polaris! Astrophotographers will also appreciate the Permanent Periodic Error Correction (PEC) feature. You can record the helical error so it\\'s automatically corrected in the future.</p>\\n<p>Power Management - The redesigned electronics supply the motors with constantly regulated voltage, allowing them to move the telescope even when it\\'s not fully balanced.

The telescope is perfect for visual observations and, with an optional polar wedge and an astro camera, also enables professional astrophotography.</strong></p>\\n<p>If you point the telescope at the planets, you\\'ll see fascinating details on the surface of Jupiter, the Cassini division of Saturn\\'s rings, and surface details on Mars. Even Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are within your reach.</p>\\n<p><em>Professional XLT computer telescopes:</em><br>With the CPC series, Celestron is introducing the most stable fork mount that has ever been available in the 40 years of production of Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. The completely newly designed tripod and a huge 280mm ball bearing in the fork base enable vibration-free observation even at the highest magnifications.</p>\\n<p>The azimuthal fork mount is not as variable as the German mount, as it is tailored to the tube diameter. This disadvantage is compensated for by the compact design, low weight, good portability\\xa0and, most importantly, incredibly quick setup. You are ready to observe in just a few minutes. Simply set up the tripod, level it with the built-in bubble level, put on the fork mount - and switch it on.</p>\\n<p><em>Built-in GPS:</em><br>The 16-channel GPS receiver transmits the time, date and location coordinates to the electronics. This means you no longer have to enter the time and location yourself - the telescope automatically has the exact data.</p>\\n<p><em>Sky Align:</em><br>This is the name of the brand new alignment process from Celestron for perfect GoTo positioning. The telescope no longer needs a defined base position: you place three bright stars (planets and the moon are also possible) in the field of view of the telescope one after the other and voilá, your CPC telescope is ready for automatic GoTo positioning on any object from the hand control database.</p>\\n<p>SkyAlign calculates the setup of your telescope from the travel distances of the three stars and the corresponding angles. SkyAlign also gets the other data required (date, time, and location coordinates) via the integrated 16-channel GPS receiver.</p>\\n<p>\"SkyAlign\" only works when the telescope is in azimuthal operation, i.e. when the telescope is operated directly on the tripod without a polar wedge. But Celestron also has some new and simplified alignment methods for parallactic operation in the CPC series.</p>\\n<p><em>Extensive database:</em><br>The CPC telescope database contains over 40,000 celestial objects, including the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as galaxies and nebulae from the NGC catalog and the planets. You can narrow down your selection to make searching this comprehensive database easier and to hide objects that are currently below the horizon.</p>\\n<p>The \"Identify\" function tells you what you are currently seeing in the telescope and also allows you to easily explore the sky. Simply point the telescope at any area of the sky and have it show you, for example, the nearest Messier objects - the telescope will navigate to them for you. You can do this in different areas of the sky and with different objects!</p>\\n<p><em>The CPC telescopes also score points with the following details:</em><br>The azimuthal fork mount has been completely redesigned. It is less susceptible to vibrations and the drive motors and gears run \"whisper quiet\" in GoTo mode. The tripod that supports the mount and telescope has also become more stable.<br>The completely newly designed tripod (landing pad) has a self-centering mounting device - no searching in the dark for the right attachment point for the mounting foot on the tripod. By rotating the mount on the tripod, the screw holes lock into the right position. Three spring-supported screws, which are anchored in the tripod, enable quick and, above all, effortless assembly in a matter of seconds. The built-in bubble level makes leveling easier. The large tripod triangle also serves as a storage area for several eyepieces.</p>\\n<p><em>Other features include:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Illuminated on/off switch on the top of the housing - so no more searching in the dark,<br></li>\\n<li>Large, easy-to-grip clamping wheels (suitable for gloves) in both axles instead of fiddly small clamping levers,<br></li>\\n<li>The \"Permanent PEC\" function stores the periodic errors of the screw to improve the tracking accuracy,<br></li>\\n<li>The electronics work with all autoguiders and planetarium programs available on the market,<br></li>\\n<li>The \"Alignment Sync\" function allows you to improve positioning accuracy during operation by confirming a new alignment object,<br></li>\\n<li>The \"Precise Goto\" function allows very faint objects to be brought extremely precisely into the center of the field of view or a CCD chip. First, a bright star close to the object being searched for is selected by the electronics and moved to it. The observer must then move it precisely to the center of the field of view using the arrow keys on the hand controller. The computer then calculates the distance from this star to the object being searched for and moves to it with high precision.<br></li>\\n<li>Finally, another new \"feature\" of the hand controls of version 4.0 of the CPC series: thanks to a flash EPROM, the control and motor software can be upgraded via the Internet.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Avoid electronic damage – remember to use the right power supply!</strong><br>To ensure the device works properly, please only use high-quality power supplies that meet the specifications for astro-use, i.e. outdoor use – cheap power supplies often only deliver the specified voltage and power at room temperature and can even damage the electronics in the worst case.

This smart telescope takes care of the complex technicalities of modern telescopes for you, transforming your backyard into a gateway to the cosmos. Equipped with cutting-edge technology and user-friendly operation, Celestron Origin captures the beauty of celestial objects and wirelessly transmits them to your tablet, smartphone, or even a TV screen.</p>\\n<p>Celestron engineers applied their decades of experience to every technical detail, from the patented optics to an intuitive control app. The result is a revolutionary, ground-up system that builds on Celestron\\'s long-standing heritage and experience, making astronomy more accessible, exciting, and fun than ever before.<br><strong>RASA optical technology:</strong><br>At the heart of the Celestron Origin lies the patented Rowe-Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph (RASA ) - a milestone in optics development. The RASA design places the image sensor at the front of the telescope, not the back, resulting in an extremely fast f/2.2 system with an exceptionally wide field of view while enabling sharp images right to the edge. Since its introduction in 2014, RASA technology has become the first choice for space surveillance and satellite tracking. Companies, researchers, and governments rely on RASA telescopes to do things like scan the skies for dangerous, tiny pieces of satellite debris that could destroy our vital communications satellites. For the Origin, Celestron engineers developed a brand-new 6-inch RASA that offers all the capabilities of an observatory-grade instrument in a portable package.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to RASA optics, the Origin is in a class of its own among smart telescopes, far surpassing other telescope designs. A RASA collects more light in less time than a smaller and slower Newtonian reflector, refractor, or other entry-level telescopes. The unique combination of fast image acquisition, aperture, and therefore detail resolution defines the RASA\\'s performance. In short, it delivers unparalleled detail in photos while maintaining short exposure times.</p>\\n<p>To fully utilize the RASA optics, Celestron selected the Sony IMX178 color CMOS sensor for image capture. It features STARVIS back-illuminated technology for maximum sensitivity and fast readout with low noise, also contributing to fast image acquisition and high sharpness. This sensitive chip features small 2.4µm pixels for high resolution—perfect for the fast optical design.</p>\\n<p><strong>Now everyone can become a real astrophotographer:</strong><br>Celestron Origin, with its built-in AI algorithms, represents a paradigm shift in sophisticated astrophotography. As the telescope acquires data, these intelligent algorithms automatically stack and process each \\xa0image in real time. The result is a stunning display of celestial objects, in color and with a wealth of detail only seen in images taken by experienced astrophotographers. For the first time, astrophotography is accessible to enthusiasts of all experience levels, including those who have never used a telescope before.</p>\\n<p><strong>Using the Celestron Origin Smart Telescope:</strong><br>A universe in your hands: StarSense technology &amp; the Origin app<br>Setting up the Celestron Origin is a breeze thanks to the automated initialization process powered by StarSense technology. Place the Origin under a clear night sky, turn it on, and connect it to the app. Then you can decide whether to stay with your telescope or head indoors. In less than two minutes, the Origin focuses itself, scans the night sky, self-orients itself by comparing star patterns with its internal database, and notifies you that it\\'s ready to use.</p>\\n<p>The Celestron Origin app , developed in collaboration with Simulation Curriculum, the creators of SkySafari™, offers an intuitive planetarium interface that simplifies navigating the night sky. Use the planetarium view, point your device at the sky, and look around in \"Compass Mode,\" then simply tap on any object you want to see (the most beautiful ones are highlighted). Or try the \"Tonight\\'s Best\" list, where Origin displays all the most impressive galaxies, nebulae, star clusters, and more—based on your exact location and time of observation. Never again will you need to consult a star atlas or plan ahead; Origin is ready to show you the universe, even if clear skies catch you off guard.</p>\\n<p>Once you select a target, the Origin precisely centers it in the field of view. Switch to the camera view and press \"Start Imaging\" to begin capturing 10-second exposures. It couldn\\'t be easier! You\\'ll see in real time how the summed photos reveal increasing detail. As the Origin works, it continuously tracks the sky and adjusts its built-in dew protection system and fans to the ambient conditions, ensuring the optics are optimally tempered for razor-sharp images.</p>\\n<p><strong>A shared cosmic experience:</strong><br>With Origin, no one has to wait their turn to look through an eyepiece. Whether your friends and family are gathered in the same room or outdoors, \\xa0multiple people can connect to Origin and view the live image on their own devices . Origin also lets you stream the live feed to your smart TV or instantly save and share your astrophotography, creating unforgettable moments beyond your viewing spot.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ready for more? Advanced features:</strong><br>As your interest in the hobby grows, you\\'ll be able to take advantage of more advanced features and capabilities. For example, Origin has a built-in filter drawer that accepts standard 1.25\" and 2\" filters. This allows you to optionally install astronomical filters, which are especially useful when photographing nebulae in light-polluted environments, such as typical suburban gardens. For imaging broadband objects such as galaxies and star clusters, or objects under dark skies, remove the filter for more light transmission and brighter images. Experiment with different and interchangeable filters to achieve results you can\\'t achieve with the fixed filters of other systems.</p>\\n<p>If you\\'d like to try advanced image processing, that\\'s also possible. Origin saves all your raw images for you. Connect via USB to import them into your favorite image editing software for manual editing and stacking.</p>\\n<p>And how about letting Origin work for you while you sleep? It\\'s easy with the Scheduled Observations feature. Simply tell the app which objects you want to capture. When you wake up, you\\'ll be greeted by spectacular images.</p>\\n<p><strong>Take your astrophotography studio anywhere:</strong><br>Celestron Origin is a portable system that doesn\\'t require external Wi-Fi networks, so you can easily take it with you in any car to distant dark skies. The optical tube, mount, and tripod all assemble and disassemble easily without tools. Each component weighs less than 7 kg.<br><strong>Your Origin system comes complete with everything you need to get started right away including:\\xa0</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>6-inch RASA optics with integrated camera<br></li>\\n<li>Origin single-arm fork mount with internal lithium battery<br></li>\\n<li>Celestron CMOS color camera with Sony IMX178LQJ sensor (back-illuminated / 2.4μm x 2.4μm pixel size)<br></li>\\n<li>Integrated computer and Wi-Fi\\xa0<br></li>\\n<li>Two built-in fans (one for the optics, one for the computer) prevent heat from accumulating in the electronics or penetrating the optical tube and impairing visibility.<br></li>\\n<li>Autofocuser<br></li>\\n<li>Dew protection heater with environmental sensor, heating ring and dew cap<br></li>\\n<li>Integrated filter drawer<br></li>\\n<li>Tripod<br></li>\\n<li>Dust cover<br></li>\\n<li>230V charger<br></li>\\n<li>Future upgrades</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>When you invest in a Celestron Origin, you can count on Celestron engineers as your long-term partners in astronomy.

With the very long 1900mm focal length, you can look forward to exciting planetary observations at high magnifications. The 150mm aperture allows you to observe smaller nebulae in the vastness of space. Find the remnants of a massive star explosion from 1054 in the constellation Taurus, or trace the glowing filaments of the Great Orion Nebula. Spot the famous Whirlpool Galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major, or find the Dumbbell Nebula in the constellation Vulpecula.

The special construction consists of a four-lens achromat which achieves minimal color error and better photographic correction than comparable two-lens devices, even with a very fast focal ratio of f/5 for a refractor.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>With the high-quality solar filter, you can safely observe sunspots, eclipses, and planetary transits. (Warning: Never point the telescope at the sun without a solar filter.)</p>\\n<p><strong>The EXOS-2 PMC-Eight Mount:</strong></p>\\n<p>The Explore Scientific EXOS-2 PMC-Eight GoTo Mount is equipped with a modern and very precise GoTo control system. It consists of a robust Wi-Fi controller unit that provides all the necessary interfaces. The NEMA-11 stepper motors are directly connected to this unit via cable, and an ST-4 compatible autoguider interface is also available. In addition, the control system supports micro-stepping to ensure precise tracking.</p>\\n<p><em>Intuitive operation via app and graphical star chart:</em><br>The ExploreStars App, developed specifically for the PMC-Eight system, impresses with a very well-designed, intuitive user interface. The featured \\'alignment stars\\' for initializing the control system, as well as all celestial objects in the database, are displayed as a star chart with additional text information. All these objects can be easily viewed and selected.</p>\\n<p><em>Powerful controller unit with Open GoTo for customization:</em><br>The heart of the controller unit consists of a completely autonomous 2-channel multi-processor with 8 CPUs and a Wi-Fi Ethernet 10/100 adapter with IP function. This allows remote operation via browser, ASCOM, app, or serial connection. The Open GoTo also allows you to write your own firmware and upload it to the controller unit. This enables custom adjustments to the device’s functions as well as the creation of custom object lists, etc.</p>\\n<p><em>Polar finder included:</em><br>The included and pre-installed polar finder scope allows for quick and precise polar alignment for longer exposure times without star trails.

However, compared to the 61EDPH II, it has an upgraded two pieces low dispersion ED glass for more excellent imaging performance. 61EDPH III (without reducer) has a focal length of 360mm, a focal ratio of f5.9, and supports the 44mm full-frame image circle. Its also a high-quality portable telescope.</p>\\n<p>The 61EDPH III upgraded the handle of the 61EDPH II to a multifunctional handle, which provides an additional universal Vixen style finder base. In addition to this, the 61EDPH III is equipped with a 200mm long Vixen style dovetail plate, easier to connect to the equatorial mounts and accessories, and makes the OTA easier to balance on the mount. As before, the tube uses high-quality CNC machining, high-grade surface painting, and polished oxidation, which is both elaborate and durable.</p>\\n<p><strong>The x0.75 Reducer (included)</strong></p>\\n<p>The special full-frame reducer: On this reducer, one end of the reducer features an M68×1 thread to connect to the focuser drawtube, the other end of the reducer has an M48×0.75 male thread with built-in 2\" filter thread. The back focus is 55mm. If it needs to be extended, this reducer can also be split to reveal an M54×0.75 female thread, and then the back focus becomes 75mm. The reducer adopts an air-spaced quadruplet structure, supporting full-frame imaging. With the reducer installed, the focal ratio of 61EDPH III is reduced to f/4.5 and the focal length reduced to 270mm.</p>\\n<p>An optional full-frame flattener and a full-frame reducer are available for the 61EDPH III, providing users with even more options:<br>The special full-frame flattener: One end of the flattener features an M68×1 male thread to connect to the focuser drawtube, the other end of the flattener has an M48×0.75 male thread with built-in 2\" filter thread. The back focus is 55mm. If it needs to be extended further, the flattener can be split to reveal an M54×0.75 female thread, and the back focus becomes 81.5mm. The flattener adopts an air-spaced triplet structure, the peripheral light reduction control is excellent and can effectively improve the curvature of the field which improves the corner image quality, and reduces aberrations.</p>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong><br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Lens: Air-spaced triplet apo (including two ED glasses)<br></li>\\n<li>Corrector: Air-spaced quadruplet design, fully multi-coated<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture: 61mm<br></li>\\n<li>Focal length: 270mm (Reducer installed)<br></li>\\n<li>Focal ratio: f/4.4 (Reducer installed)<br></li>\\n<li>Limiting visual magnitude: 10.7<br></li>\\n<li>Resolution: 1.93 arc seconds<br></li>\\n<li>Image circle: 44mm<br></li>\\n<li>Focuser: 2.5\" dual-speed rack-and-pinion precision focuser, 360 rotatable<br></li>\\n<li>Back side connections: M48x0.75 male thread, M54x0.75 male thread with increased back focus<br></li>\\n<li>Back side connections without reducer: \\xa0 \\xa0M68x1 male thread, 2\", 1.25\"<br></li>\\n<li>Back focus: 55mm (75mm from M54 thread)<br></li>\\n<li>Finder shoe: For Vixen type finder brackets<br></li>\\n<li>Mounting options: Vixen style dovetail bar (200mm) with 1/4-20 photo thread and 6 M6 threads, handle with ARCA-SWISS slot<br></li>\\n<li>Tube material: Aluminum<br></li>\\n<li>Transport length: 272mm<br></li>\\n<li>Tube outer diameter: 75mm<br></li>\\n<li>Dew shield diameter: 82.6mm (87.2mm with cap)<br></li>\\n<li>Telescope height: 144mm<br></li>\\n<li>Weight: approx. 2.4kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>SharpStar 61EDPH III Triplet APO Refractor</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>0.75x reducer</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>2\" and 1.25\" eyepiece adapters</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Covers</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Finder shoe</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Tube ring</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Dovetail bar</em><br>\\n</li>\\n<li><em>Handle</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000367-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 1413.05, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Sharpstar61-EDPH-III-APO-Refractor-Telescope_1.jpg?v=1754238918', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

Instead of buying extra flatteners, calculating the backfocus of flattener or making tedious connection to match the distance, astrophotographers can simply equip it with any possible imaging devices, make the target stay at the focus, and then the whole optical system is perfect for imaging.</p>\\n<p><em>High quality imaging optics:</em><br>130PHQ has an aperture 23mm larger than 107PHQ. 130PHQ has a focal ratio of f/7.7 and a focal length of 1000mm. The Petzval-like quadruplet lens with two ED glasses offers excellent control of chromatic and other aberrations. With its self-flattening design, 130PHQ offers strong advantages in astronomical photography. It supports a medium frame 60mm image circle, has a fine spot diagram with only tiny distortion of the peripheral stars, and its central RMS radius is less than 2 microns.</p>\\n<p>The Askar 130PHQ is a true all-rounder with f/7.7 - it is designed as a telescope for almost all applications:<br></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>With 1000mm focal length and the large corrected field of view, extended objects can be imaged. But equally, fine details of objects can be brought out when cameras with high resolution are used.<br></li>\\n<li>The use of different cameras with different flange focal lengths is no problem. Simply focus and you are always at the correct distance.<br></li>\\n<li>The focuser has large travel, so you can find the focus without problems.<br></li>\\n<li>The working distance or backfocus from the 2\" receptacle is long enough to use 2\" star diagonals. This turns the flatfield apo into a wide field telescope or even a planetary telescope, depending on the eyepiece used.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Practical features:</em><br>130PHQ comes with a telescopic lens hood, a high quality CNC machined and painted tube and attractive decorative parts. The rigid 3.4\" focuser comes with M68, M54, and M48 adapters and a finder base. When used with the optional 3\" 0.7x flat field reducer, the telescope can reach a focal ratio of f/5.4 and a focal length of 700mm, effectively reducing exposure time considerably. The multifunctional handle comes with a central slot for attaching an M6 screw with an M6 screw hole. It has a standard Losmandy style dovetail plate, together with sturdy double tube ring and is perfectly suited for both viewing and imaging.</p>\\n<p><em>The photographic 3.4\" Rack &amp; Pinion focuser:</em><br>The CNC focuser is optimized for photography and can handle a load of up to 8kg. The adjustment range is very generous. The focusing is done via rack and pinion which is decoupled from the bearing of the draw tube. This guarantees fine and precise adjustment even at maximum load. In addition to the 1.25\" and 2\" receptacle, the focuser also offers threads for screw on adaptations.</p>\\n<p>Every single APO is checked in the technical department before it is put into storage in order to guarantee its consistently delivered to you in the highest quality.<br></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The mechanics are tested and the focuser is optimally adjusted.<br>The lens is cosmetically checked and cleaned. The quality team also check that all counter screws are correctly tightened. These often loosen during transportation.<br></li>\\n<li>The optics are collimated and the result is checked on the optical bench.

It has M86, M68, M54, M48 adapters, and the M48 one has an internal thread that can fit 2\" filters.</p>\\n<p>A 300mm Vixen-style dovetail plate also makes it easier to balance on the equatorial mount.</p>\\n<p><strong>Spec:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Objective lens: Fully air-spaced sextuplet apo (including two ED glasses)<br></li>\\n<li>Aperture: 100mm<br></li>\\n<li>Focal Length: 550mm</li>\\n<li>Focal ratio: f/5.5<br></li>\\n<li>Image circle: 36mm<br></li>\\n<li>Focuser: 3.4\" rack and pinion, dual speed<br></li>\\n<li>Back focus: 77mm from the M48 thread<br></li>\\n<li>Rear-end thread: M48x0.75 male thread<br></li>\\n<li>Adapters: M86x1-M68x1, M68x1-M54x0.75, M54x0.75-M54x0.75, M54x0.75-M48x0.75 (with M48x0.75 filter thread)<br></li>\\n<li>Dew Shield: Retractable<br></li>\\n<li>Total length: 482mm<br></li>\\n<li>Weight of tube without tube ring and dovetail bar: 4.3kg<br></li>\\n<li>Weight tube incl. tube ring and dovetail bar: 5.6kg<br></li>\\n<li>Gross weight incl. case and all accessories: 9.3kg</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Whats included:</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em>Telescope</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Standard finder shoe</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Tube ring</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Dovetail plate (Vixen style)</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Handle</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>4-piece photographical adapter</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Warranty card</em><br></li>\\n<li>\\n<em>Manual</em><br></li>\\n<li><em>Hard case</em></li>\\n</ol>', 'Published': 'TRUE', 'Handle': 'SK0000371-UK', 'Variant Compare At Price': 2679.24, 'Variant Price': 169.99, 'Image Src': 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0596/1924/6275/files/Sharpstar-Askar-Z4-APO-Refractor-Telescope.jpg?v=1754319692', 'Image Position': '1'}\n",

         "<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>This high resolution and very capable deep sky Astro camera comes with a large Panasonic CMOS sensor and active camera cooling.</strong><br>With the new Explore Scientific Deep Sky Astro camera you get a modern complete package for the comfortable shooting of astro photos and videos. Finally, an easy-to-use camera for capturing galaxies, star clusters, the moon and even planets with high resolution and very low sensor noise. Thanks to the fast USB 3.0 computer interface, all image data is transferred within a seconds. Long waiting times are now a thing of the past.<br>Simply connect the camera to your telescope using the T2 female thread (M42.0.75mm) or the supplied 2\" (50.8mm) plug-in adapter and after installing the drivers and the included 'Explore Capture' recording and editing software, you are ready to take your Astro photos to the next level.<br>The Explore Capture Pro software included not only offers the basic functions required for image and video capture, but also many helpful special functions for image post-processing and camera setup. Functions such as live image display, exposure settings, white balance, dark image print, stacking, time-lapse recording and so much more can be configured separately.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Choose to use the automatic settings to produce absolutely fantastic results without any previous knowledge or simply switch off the automatic settings and adjust the individual professional settings to your own preference - Its up to you.<br>The new Explore Deep Sky Camera has a highly sensitive and very low-noise Panasonic CMOS sensor which can also be cooled down to 40°C below ambient temperature by the two-stage thermoelectric cooling. In contrast to normal DSLR cameras, this guarantees much lower noise and fewer hot pixels in your shots. This results in images that are not only much sharper and more brilliant, but also contain more usable image information.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Through the controlled setting of the desired camera temperature, you can now produce dark frames under reproducible shooting conditions at any time. The large-format CMOS sensor with 21.9mm diagonal also allows large image fields and makes the adjustment and centering of objects considerably easier. <br>The camera has a built-in USB hub with 2 x USB2.0 ports at the rear. Connect your additional Auto-guider camera or motor focus etc. via a short USB cable and reduce the risk of cable spaghetti and cable breaks. Separate cable connections between your accessories and your computer are also no longer necessary. <br></div>\n<div>\n<br><strong>Key Camera Features:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Camera type: ASTRO Camera 16.0MP ATR3CMOS16000KPA </li>\n<li>Data output: single pictures and video </li>\n<li>Image Sensor: Panasonic NM34230PLI CMOS Color Sensor </li>\n<li>Adjustable resolution: 4648x3506 / 2304x1750 / 1536x1168 </li>\n<li>Adjustable binning: 1x1 / 2x2 / 3x3 </li>\n<li>Frame rate per second (FBS): 22.5 / 43 / 48 </li>\n<li>Physical sensor size in pixels: 4648 x 3506 </li>\n<li>Megapixel: 16 MP </li>\n<li>Sensor size: 17.6 x 13.3 mm (4/3 inch) </li>\n<li>Pixel size: 3.8 µm x 3.8 µm </li>\n<li>Bit depth: 12 Bit </li>\n<li>Backfocus: 17,5 mm  </li>\n<li>Shutter Type: rolling shutter</li>\n<li>Internal camera memory: DDR 3 RAM</li>\n<li>Thermoelectric cooling with fan: yes, up to 40°C below ambient temperature </li>\n<li>Adjustable exposure times: 150µs to 60min </li>\n<li>Operating temperature: -10 to +50°C (30-80% RLH) </li>\n<li>Cable length USB 3.0: 150cm </li>\n<li>DC cable length power supply: 200cm </li>\n<li>CNC machined aluminium housing </li>\n<li>Camera diameter: 80mm; length: 102mm </li>\n<li>Camera weight: 0,53 kg </li>\n<li>Camera connection diameter: 2.0 inch ( 50.8mm) </li>\n<li>Camera connection thread: T2 (M42x0,75mm) </li>\n<li>Filter thread: Yes, 2.0 inch in receptacle </li>\n<li>Camera connection to PC: USB 3.0 </li>\n<li>Built-in USB hub with 2 x USB 2.0 ports </li>\n<li>Power supply: Power supply 12 Volt 3,0 Ampere included </li>\n<li>Software: EXPLORE Capture included </li>\n<li>Camera driver and ASCOM driver included</li>\n<li>Operating system: WINDOWS 7, 8 and 10 </li>\n<li>PC requirements: CPU Intel Core2 2.8Ghz or higher / 2 GB Ram / USB 3.0<br></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>General Technical Data:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>One Shot Colour Astro Camera 16.0MP</li>\n<li>Material: Blue - Aluminium Casing</li>\n<li>Dimensions: Length 102mm, Diameter 80mm</li>\n<li>Net Weight: 530g (without Accessories) </li>\n<li>Telescope adapter T2 thread to 2.0\" (50,8mm) </li>\n<li>USB 3.0 connection cable 150cm </li>\n<li>Power supply 230V/12V3,0A (Included) </li>\n<li>Dust cap</li>\n<li>Software CD </li>\n<li>Hard case </li>\n<li>Instruction manual</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div><span><strong>DOWNLOAD YOUR CAMERA SOFTWARE &amp; MANUAL HERE:</strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Download the Astro Cam ASCOM &amp; Software Drivers <a>here</a></span></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

You can also power the mount using a suitable mains adapter or 12V car plug adapter. The rigid tripod and mount assembly allows a generous payload of up to 13kg - perfect for small to medium sized Telescopes.<br><em>EXOS-2 GOTO System:</em> <br>The Startracker GoTo System enables beginners with little experience to start astronomical observations in just a few minutes, and guides you to various objects in the night sky that are not visible through the small finder scope.</p>\n<p>At the push of a button you can locate Planets, Nebulae or Galaxies in minutes. The database on the Startracker system holds thousands of celestial objects to choose from.<br></p>\n<p>The Bresser StarTracker GoTo systems also uses servo motors for both axes and features an ST-4 compatible autoguiding input - essential for long exposure Astrophotography.

         "<p><strong>For many years Bresser Newtonian telescopes have become the standard workhorse for Deep Sky astrophotography, now the second generation of this telescope, the Bresser NT-203s/800 comes with an improved Hexafoc focusser and fast parabolic main mirror. </strong></p>\n<p>The Bresser NT-203s/800 f3.9 will deliver you much more detailed images at shorter exposures due to its oversized primary mirror and therefore faster optical system (f3.9, compared to standard f5 telescopes of this size). The large 85 mm secondary mirror also helps reduce vignetting for maximum optimal illumination of the target. The excellent 2,5\" Hexafoc focuser also helps reduce vignetting due to its large diameter and makes focussing a joy - the smoothness and shifting-free operation sets a new standard in this price class.<br><em>BRESSER EXOS-2 GoTo Equatorial Mount:</em><br>This German Equatorial Mount has tracking motors in both axes that follow celestial objects very smoothly and precisely. The hand controller with full GOTO abilities works reliably and is very user friendly - See Manual download below. Precision ball bearings in both axes help ensure minimal backlash at all nine possible tracking speeds and the 12V battery pack is conveniently fastened to the tripod shelf and takes eight size D batteries. The mount can also be powered using a mains or car plug adapter (sold seperately)<br><em>EXOS-2 GOTO System:</em><br>The Startracker GoTo System enables beginners with little experience to start astronomical observations in just a few minutes, and guides you to various objects in the nigt sky that are not visible through the small finder scope. At the push of a button you can locate Planets, Nebulae or Galaxies in minutes. The database on the Startracker system holds thousands of celestial objects to choose from.<br>The Bresser StarTracker GoTo systems also uses servo motors for both axes and features an ST-4 compatible autoguiding input - essential for long exposure Astrophotography. The menu and navigation of the Startracker hand controller is also multilingual and offers a choice of German, English, French, Spanish and Italian.<br><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optical design: Newtonian Reflector</li>\n<li>Mirror diameter: 203mm / focal length: 800mm / F/3.9</li>\n<li>Maximum recommended magnification: x 406</li>\n<li>Telescope for night and solar observing</li>\n<li>Very high quality Hexafoc focuser with 2.5\" free inner diameter</li>\n<li>Diffraction limited optics with parabolic main mirror</li>\n<li>8x50 straight through viewfinder with reticle</li>\n<li>Optimized finder socket for comfortable use</li>\n<li>Cradle rings with handle and integrated piggyback camera holder (1/4 thread)</li>\n<li>Smartphone adapter for celestial navigation included</li>\n<li>Dovetail plate with stainless steel rail</li>\n<li>Can be connected to SLR cameras (optional T2 ring required)</li>\n<li>50.8mm (2) to 31.7mm (1.25) adapter with integrated T2 thread (T2-adapter ring for your camera is needed)</li>\n<li>Backfocus fully inward focused: 60mm</li>\n<li>85mm secondary mirror for optimal illumination</li>\n<li>Large knobs for primary and secondary mirror adjustment</li>\n<li>Tube without accessories: 8.7 kg - Tube with all accessories mounted: 11.5 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Mount Spec:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Stable parallactic mount with fine drive in both axes</li>\n<li>Ball bearings in both axes for more precise movements</li>\n<li>Stable height adjustable stainless steel tripod ( Min. 69cm / Max. 109.5cm )</li>\n<li>Load capacity up to 13 kg payload</li>\n<li>Circular bubble for easy horizontal alignment</li>\n<li>GoTo Mount with motors and hand box controller, for easy finding and guiding moon, planets, stars and much more</li>\n<li>ST-4 compatible autoguider interface</li>\n<li>Pole height scale for setting the latitude</li>\n<li>Scaled graduated circular rings to facilitate finding objects using a star atlas or planetarium software</li>\n<li>Pole finder scope with optional illumination ( item no. 4964212 )</li>\n<li>Tripod weight: 4.6 kg</li>\n<li>Mount weight: 5.3 kg (without counterweight)</li>\n<li>Total weight incl. counterweight: 23.6 kg</li>\n<li>Batteries: Require Size D Batteries (not included).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weight &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Net weight OTA (incl. accessories): 11.5 kg</li>\n<li>Total length: 100 cm</li>\n<li>Total width: 100 cm</li>\n<li>Total height: 175 cm</li>\n<li>Tube diameter: 235 mm</li>\n<li>Tube length: 700 mm</li>\n<li>Net Weight total (incl. accessories): 31 kg</li>\n<li>Counterweights: 2 x 4.5 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OTA</li>\n<li>26mm Super Plössl eyepiece (31.7mm / 1.25\")</li>\n<li>Integrated 31.7 mm and T2 adapter</li>\n<li>Prism rail with stainless steel clamping surface</li>\n<li>Adapter for 50.8 mm (2\") eyepieces</li>\n<li>8x50 optical viewfinder</li>\n<li>Rotatable star map</li>\n<li>Aperture solar filter</li>\n<li>Tube clamp with handle and camera holder</li>\n<li>Smartphone camera adapter</li>\n<li>Adjustable polar finder scope with optional illumination</li>\n<li>Astronomy PC software Stellarium (via download)</li>\n<li>Equatorial EXOS 2 GOTO mount with stainless steel tripod and Startracker handcontroller</li>\n<li>Stainless steel tube field tripod with accessory tray</li>\n<li>2 x 4.5 kg counterweight</li>\n<li>Battery Pack (Excluding Batteries)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Download the Startracker &amp; GOTO System </span>Manual <a>here</a><br>Download the Bresser Messier Mount &amp; Telescope Manual <a>here</a></p>\n<p><em>SAFETY NOTICE:</em> <span>Never look directly at the Sun through your Binoculars or Telescope - immediate and permanent eye damage may result.

         "<p><strong>The Bresser Messier MC-127 Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope offers high rigidity and tack-sharp optics - Its an ideal telescope for Lunar and Planetary viewing as well as some of the brighter deep space targets. </strong></p>\n<p>The high rigidity of the EXOS-2 GoTo mount allows for more stable and relaxed observations and is an ideal platform for those making their first attempts at astrophotography - particularly for planetary work.<br><em>BRESSER EXOS-2 GoTo Equatorial Mount:</em><br>This German Equatorial Mount has tracking motors in both axes that follow celestial objects very smoothly and precisely. The hand controller with full GOTO abilities works reliably and is very user friendly - See Manual download below. Precision ball bearings in both axes help ensure minimal backlash at all nine possible tracking speeds and the 12V battery pack is conveniently fastened to the tripod shelf and takes eight size D batteries. The mount can also be powered using a mains or car plug adapter (sold seperately)<br><em>EXOS-2 GOTO System:</em><br>The Startracker GoTo System enables beginners with little experience to start astronomical observations in just a few minutes, and guides you to various objects in the nigt sky that are not visible through the small finder scope. At the push of a button you can locate Planets, Nebulae or Galaxies in minutes. The database on the Startracker system holds thousands of celestial objects to choose from.<br>The Bresser StarTracker GoTo systems also uses servo motors for both axes and features an ST-4 compatible autoguiding input - essential for long exposure Astrophotography. The menu and navigation of the Startracker hand controller is also multilingual and offers a choice of German, English, French, Spanish and Italian.<br><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optical design: Maksutov-Cassegrain</li>\n<li>Maximum recommended magnification: 254x</li>\n<li>Aperture: 127 mm</li>\n<li>Focal length: 1900 mm</li>\n<li>Aperture ratio: f/15</li>\n<li>Optical coatings: Multi-Coating</li>\n<li>Universal 44 mm Dovetail plate with stainless steel rail (fits LXD75/Great Polaris/EQ5)</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Mount Spec:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Stable parallactic mount with fine drive in both axes</li>\n<li>Ball bearings in both axes for more precise movements</li>\n<li>Stable height adjustable stainless steel tripod ( Min. 69cm / Max. 109.5cm )</li>\n<li>Max Payload: 13 kg</li>\n<li>Circular bubble for easy horizontal alignment</li>\n<li>GoTo Mount with motors and hand box controller, for easy finding and guiding moon, planets, stars and much more</li>\n<li>ST-4 compatible autoguider interface</li>\n<li>Pole height scale for setting the latitude</li>\n<li>Scaled graduated circular rings to facilitate finding objects using a star atlas or planetarium software</li>\n<li>Pole finder scope with optional illumination ( item no. 4964212 )</li>\n<li>Tripod weight: 4.6 kg</li>\n<li>Mount weight: 5.3 kg (without counterweight)</li>\n<li>Total weight incl. counterweight: 23.6 kg</li>\n<li>Batteries: Require Size D Batteries (not included).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weight &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Net weight OTA (incl. accessories): 3.4 kg</li>\n<li>Tripod &amp; Mount Weight: 23.6 kg</li>\n<li>Total length: 100 cm</li>\n<li>Total width: 100 cm</li>\n<li>Total height: 165 cm</li>\n<li>Tripod height adjustment: Yes</li>\n<li>Maximum load capacity: 13 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maksutov OTA</li>\n<li>26mm SuperPlössl eyepiece (31.7 mm / 1.25'')</li>\n<li>SC Eyepiece adapter (31.7 mm / 1.25'')</li>\n<li>Star diagonal mirror</li>\n<li>Dovetail plate for GP Level</li>\n<li>LED viewfinder</li>\n<li>Adjustable polar finder scope with optional illumination</li>\n<li>Aperture solar-filter</li>\n<li>Rotatable star map</li>\n<li>Astronomy Software Stellarium (via download)</li>\n<li>Equatorial EXOS 2 GOTO mount and Startracker handcontroller</li>\n<li>Stainless steel tube field tripod with accessory tray</li>\n<li>1 x 4.5 kg counterweight</li>\n</ul>\n\nDownload the Startracker &amp; GOTO System Manual <a>here</a><br>Download the Bresser Messier Mount &amp; Telescope Manual <a>here<br></a> <br><p><em>SAFETY NOTICE:</em> <span>Never look directly at the Sun through your Binoculars or Telescope - immediate and permanent eye damage may result.

         "<p><strong>For many years Bresser Newtonian telescopes have become the standard workhorse for Deep Sky astrophotography, now the second generation of this telescope, the Bresser NT-203s/800 comes with an improved Hexafoc focusser and fast parabolic main mirror. </strong></p>\n<p>The Bresser NT-203s/800 f3.9 will deliver you much more detailed images at shorter exposures due to its oversized primary mirror and therefore faster optical system (f3.9, compared to standard f5 telescopes of this size). The large 85 mm secondary mirror also helps reduce vignetting for maximum optimal illumination of the target. The excellent 2,5\" Hexafoc focuser also helps reduce vignetting due to its large diameter and makes focussing a joy - the smoothness and shifting-free operation sets a new standard in this price class.<br><em>BRESSER EXOS-2 Equatorial Mount:</em><br>The Bresser EXOS-2 is a rugged German Equatorial Mount offering high rigidity and precision tracking for visual observation as well as astrophotography. The tripod is extremely sturdy and designed to suppress vibrations very well. As with all the Bressier Messier range, this mount is built to extremely high standards and comes with an illuminated polar finder scope and precise graduated circles for more accuracy and ease of use during polar alignement. - If you wish at a later stage to upgrade the mount to a full computerised GOTO system, a powered two axis GOTO-Kit is available as an optional extra. The EXOS-2 mounts is designed to take a max payload weight up to 13kg allowing you to use refractors of up to 152 mm aperture or mirror telescopes of up to 203 mm aperture.<br><strong>Telescope Spec:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optical design: Newtonian Reflector</li>\n<li>Mirror diameter: 203mm / focal length: 800mm / F/3.9</li>\n<li>Maximum recommended magnification: x 406</li>\n<li>Telescope for night and solar observing</li>\n<li>Very high quality Hexafoc focuser with 2.5\" free inner diameter</li>\n<li>Diffraction limited optics with parabolic main mirror</li>\n<li>8x50 straight through viewfinder with reticle</li>\n<li>Optimized finder socket for comfortable use</li>\n<li>Cradle rings with handle and integrated piggyback camera holder (1/4 thread)</li>\n<li>Smartphone adapter for celestial navigation included</li>\n<li>Dovetail plate with stainless steel rail</li>\n<li>Can be connected to SLR cameras (optional T2 ring required)</li>\n<li>50.8mm (2) to 31.7mm (1.25) adapter with integrated T2 thread (T2-adapter ring for your camera is needed)</li>\n<li>Backfocus fully inward focused: 60mm</li>\n<li>85mm secondary mirror for optimal illumination</li>\n<li>Large knobs for primary and secondary mirror adjustment</li>\n<li>Tube without accessories: 8.7 kg - Tube with all accessories mounted: 11.5 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Mount Spec:</strong><br><ul>\n<li>Stable parallactic mount with fine drive in both axes</li>\n<li>Ball bearings in both axes for more precise movements</li>\n<li>Stable height adjustable stainless steel tripod ( Min. 69cm / Max. 109.5cm )</li>\n<li>Load capacity up to 13 kg payload</li>\n<li>Circular bubble for easy horizontal alignment</li>\n<li>(Optional) GoTo system with motors and hand box controller is available as an upgrade.</li>\n<li>ST-4 compatible autoguider interface</li>\n<li>Pole height scale for setting the latitude</li>\n<li>Scaled graduated circular rings to facilitate finding objects using a star atlas or planetarium software</li>\n<li>Pole finder scope with optional illumination ( item no. 4964212 )</li>\n<li>Tripod weight: 4.6 kg</li>\n<li>Mount weight: 5.3 kg (without counterweight)</li>\n<li>Total weight incl. counterweight: 23.6 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weight &amp; Dimensions:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Net weight OTA (incl. accessories): 11.5 kg</li>\n<li>Total length: 100 cm</li>\n<li>Total width: 100 cm</li>\n<li>Total height: 175 cm</li>\n<li>Tube diameter: 235 mm</li>\n<li>Tube length: 700 mm</li>\n<li>Net Weight total (incl. accessories): 30.5 kg</li>\n<li>Net weight mount (incl. accessories): 19 kg</li>\n<li>Counterweights: 2 x 4.5 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Whats included:</em><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OTA<br></li>\n<li>26mm Super Plössl eyepiece (31.7mm / 1.25\")</li>\n<li>Integrated 31.7 mm and T2 adapter</li>\n<li>Prism rail with stainless steel clamping surface</li>\n<li>Adapter for 50.8 mm (2\") eyepieces</li>\n<li>8x50 optical viewfinder</li>\n<li>Rotatable star map</li>\n<li>Aperture solar filter</li>\n<li>Tube clamp with handle and camera holder</li>\n<li>Smartphone camera adapter</li>\n<li>Adjustable polar finder scope with optional illumination</li>\n<li>Astronomy PC software Stellarium (via download)</li>\n<li>BRESSER EXOS-2 mount (Non-GOTO)</li>\n<li>Stainless steel tube field tripod with accessory tray</li>\n<li>2 x 4.5kg Counterweights</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download the Bresser Messier Mount &amp; Telescope Manual <a>here</a></p>\n<p><em>SAFETY NOTICE:</em> <span>Never look directly at the Sun through your Binoculars or Telescope - immediate and permanent eye damage may result.

         "<p><strong>The Bresser Messier 8\" Dobsonian offers the performance and qualities rivaling many other more expensive telescopes, infact there are many dedicated Dobsonian telescope users groups, passionate about these designs and given the outstanding performance of these telescopes and their price, its easy to see why. </strong></p>\n<p>The optical diameter of 203mm (8\") does not limit your observations to solar system objects such as the moon or the planets - These telescope designs allow you to reach much further into deep space and explore globular / open star clusters, nebulae and galaxies.<br>With a Telescope of this aperture objects are beginning to show some structure: globular clusters are no longer only fuzzy circles, but are resolved into masses of individual stars. Nebulae, that can only be barely detected in smaller scopes, start to reveal structures within. The excellent Hexafoc focuser boosts a large 2.5\" diameter so that you don't have vignetting in big widefield eyepieces that can occur in smaller focuser barrels.</p>\n<p>The big altitude wheels handle the large heavy optics without issue - and if you decide to use even larger accessories (like a bino-viewer with two eyepieces) then you can move the tube in its tube rings and achieve balance within seconds. If you need to transport or store the telescope, the rocker box disassembles (and re-assembles) very easily.<br><strong>Telescope Specs:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optical design: Reflector</li>\n<li>Mirror diameter: 203 mm</li>\n<li>Focal length: 1218 mm / f/6</li>\n<li>Maximum recommended magnification: x 406</li>\n<li>High quality BRESSER Newton optics</li>\n<li>Parabolic primary mirror</li>\n<li>Primary mirror diameter: 203 mm</li>\n<li>2.5\" HEXAFOC focus</li>\n<li>primary mirror made using special-purpose glass with very little thermal expansion</li>\n<li>Shifting-free focusing, even with heavy accessories</li>\n<li>Easy to move the tube</li>\n<li>Rocker Box easily Disassembled / Reassembled</li>\n<li>OTA can be attached to other mountings</li>\n<li>Differently sized adjusting- and lock-screws</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dimensions &amp; Weight:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Net weight OTA: (incl. accessories) 11.5 kg</li>\n<li>Total length: 128 cm</li>\n<li>Total width: 48 cm</li>\n<li>Total height: 48 cm</li>\n<li>Tube diameter: 250 mm</li>\n<li>Tube length: 1150 mm</li>\n<li>Net Weight total (incl. accessories): 21 kg</li>\n<li>Net weight mount (incl. accessories): 9.5 kg</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Whats included:</em><br><ul>\n<li>Newtonian OTA</li>\n<li>Aperture solar-filter</li>\n<li>6x30 viewfinder</li>\n<li>25mm SuperPloessl eyepiece (Ø 31,7 mm / 1,25'')</li>\n<li>1 Extension shell 37,5mm for 2.5'' Hexafoc</li>\n<li>1 Eyepiece adapter Ø 31,7 to 50,8 mm</li>\n<li>2 Tube clamps</li>\n<li>2 Altitude wheels</li>\n<li>1 Rockerbox with 2 ground boards and assembly material</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download the Bresser Dobsonian Manual <a>here<br></a></p>\n<p><em>SAFETY NOTICE:</em> <span>Never look directly at the Sun through your Binoculars or Telescope - immediate and permanent eye damage may result.
