```powershell
#set theme
<# which them I like?
    #the posh has its default theme(set by the oh-my-posh and posh-git module!(the default(basic) theme take 1000ms about to load theme)),so even you don't set the poshPrompt,it has its default theme and overhead(performance consume)

    iterm2
    blueish #700ms 
    hunk #it take 600ms about
    iterm_cxxu #1700ms
    rudolfs-light #600ms
    ...
    there,I customized a theme based on the `iterm2`:iterm2_cxxu
    it is defined in the path which the same as the the original themes
    (the Get-PoshTheme will tell you the location of the themes in the last line)
    to custimized your own theme based on the existing themes,you can copy which your want to extend ,then modify and over and over again 
    to make it be your favorite one.
